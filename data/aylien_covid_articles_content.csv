Johnson reportedly went to the unspecified London hospital after his doctor advised him to do so. A press release from his office called the move ""precautionary."" 
On March 26, Johnson revealed he had tested positive and that he had been dealing with symptoms since that date. Britain had gone into lockdown two days earlier.
Since the 26th, Johnson has been quarantined at his Downing Street residence. He is the first known world leader to have contracted the virus. 
Roughly a month ago, right around the time the U.K. started dealing with an outbreak, Johnson garnered media coverage for saying he'd shook hands with coronavirus patients during a hospital visit.  
""I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,"" Johnson said during a press conference that took place on March 3. His positive test was registered 23 days later. 
On Saturday, Johnson's fiancée, Carrie Symonds, tweeted out that she'd spent a week in bed with coronavirus symptoms. She had not officially been tested for the disease, but said she felt ""stronger"" and ""on the mend"" following the week of rest:"

Wildlife Conservation Society




  

  
  Nadia, a four-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, has become the first tiger in the world to test positive for the coronavirus. It is the first known case of an animal contracting the coronavirus in the United States.  Nadia’s sister Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions have also developed a dry cough, a symptom that is typical of COVID-19 patients. Because of the difficulty of obtaining samples from big cats, only one was tested. Besides a bit of loss of appetite all the Bronx Zoo animals are doing well, the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo said in a statement. The zoo has been closed since March 16.



  



  



  
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed the finding and said it marked the first case of a tiger testing positive for COVID-19. The big cats were likely infected by an asymptomatic staff member.



  



  



  
  Even though all the big cats infected with COVID-19 are expected to make a full recovery the positive test raises fresh questions about how the virus is transmitted to animals. No pets in the United States have tested positive for the virus and there is no evidence to suggest that animals can transmit COVID-19 to people. A dog in Hong Kong tested positive, which led officials to conclude animals could test positive if they had been exposed by humans but could not transmit the virus to humans.



  
  The USDA says anyone who is sick with the coronavirus should restrict contact with animals as much as possible. If someone who is sick with the coronavirus must take care of a pet or be around animals, “they should wash their hands before and after the interaction,” notes the USDA. Experts also recommend that pets of owners who are infected with COVID-19 should be kept inside as much as possible."
Why John Dickerson wrote about acknowledging each other's grief as the coronavirus takes its toll,2020-04-05 23:57:57+00:00,http://feeds.cbsnews.com/~r/CBSNewsMain/~3/puktkAcVnJA/,"['https://www.cbs.com/shows/60_minutes/video', 'https://www.facebook.com/60minutes', 'https://twitter.com/60minutes', 'https://www.cbs.com/watch/rd/5sJ_tg8ETE1HMcN2RC4AUGEFRw9kfaID/?ftag=CNM-00-10abb6c', 'https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/the-grieving-world/609013/', 'https://cbs.avature.net/cbsnewscareers', 'http://www.cbsinteractive.com/careers', 'https://www.cbsstore.com/collections/cbs-news?v=cbs-news', 'https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/highlights', 'https://ca.privacy.cbs', 'https://ca.privacy.cbs/donotsell', 'https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/privacy-policy/third-party-online-advertising', 'https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/terms-of-use', 'https://www.cbsinteractive.com/legal/cbsi/mobile-eula', 'https://www.cbscorporation.com/', 'https://www.cbsinteractive.com/advertising', 'https://www.cbs.com/closed-captioning/', 'https://www.facebook.com/CBSNews', 'https://twitter.com/CBSNews', 'http://www.youtube.com/user/CBSNewsOnline']",0,0,"['Dickerson', 'coronavirus', 'grief', 'John', 'toll', 'people', 'human', 'time', 'political', 'sense', 'COVID-19', 'family', 'kind', 'care', 'intended', 'message', 'confusion', 'neighbors', 'relatives', 'The Atlantic', 'health care', '60 Minutes', 'clapping', 'creed', 'coping', 'virus', 'anxiety', '#Coronavirus', '#Anxiety', '#Virus', '#TheAtlantic', '#60Minutes', '#Coping', '#HealthCare', '#Clapping', '#Creed']","Amid the confusion and anxiety of coronavirus news, John Dickerson wants people to take time to acknowledge what has been lost. For an increasing number of Americans, that means a loved one.

Behind the growing numbers of people who have died from COVID-19, there are friends and family members in mourning. Recently, Dickerson saw that sorrow up close when he spoke to a friend whose close family member died from the virus. He also saw the disconnect between what that family felt and the broader political debate occurring about the coronavirus.

To make sense of that clash, he wrote about it in an article for The Atlantic.

""The response has been pretty powerful, from all sorts of different people,"" Dickerson told 60 Minutes Overtime. ""And so a lot of people when they read it, passed it around, either because they were experiencing grief, or because they knew somebody that was, or because they were having a kind of anticipatory grief and sorrow about this confusing moment that we're all in.""

Part of what makes this moment so confusing, Dickerson said, is that people can no longer do what they usually do when a loved one dies. Due to social distancing and mandates against gatherings, they cannot have a funeral, nor hug relatives who have gathered. In most instances, they are not even able to be with their loved one in person before they die, especially if its due to COVID-19.

""All of the normal coping mechanisms are taken away,"" Dickerson said. ""And that is an acute situation for the people going through it, but also for the rest of us. This is something new for all of us to be experiencing this at the same time.""

For Dickerson, that sense of unity in grief is what will help people get through it. He pointed to the collective applause that New Yorkers give at 7 pm each evening in thanks to health care workers who are taking care of the sick. The sounds of clapping hands and banging pots, he said, goes beyond the intended message.

""It's also all of us neighbors hearing each other, participating in that together, all having the same human reaction, regardless of our politics or our creed or our religions or races or where we come from, that we're all expressing the same kind of gratitude at the same time,"" he said, ""which is not only a good thing to be doing collectively, but it also reminds us all that we, at the very basic level, are all human beings.""

 Benham and his sons were supporting pro-life sidewalk counselors who offer counseling to “at-risk mothers and babies” heading in and out of Preferred Women’s Health Center. 
 “You know I am well within my constitutional authority to be here,” Benham said as he was handcuffed, a video showed. “You know that we are doing the right thing.”
 
Police arrested David Benham and his son Saturday for violating coronavirus distancing orders while offering sidewalk counseling outside a North Carolina abortion clinic — an incident he said was targeted.
 Benham, who started the pro-life sidewalk counseling service Cities4Life in 2010, told the Daily Caller News Foundation he received a call from some of the sidewalk counselors Saturday morning saying there were police outside Preferred Women’s Health Center in Charlotte, North Carolina.
 
 Benham is a Christian entrepreneur and former professional baseball player who gained media attention after he and his brother Jason Benham’s reality HGTV show was canceled over the brothers’ religious views.
 Three members of Cities4Life were at the clinic offering counseling Saturday, according to Benham, who said he drove to the clinic with two of his sons after hearing about the police.
 “We are a federally recognized 501(c)(3) public charity,” he told the DCNF of Cities4Life. “We are an essential business. We have both a local ordinance, a stay in shelter local ordinance, and a stay in shelter state ordinance.”
 Cities4Life is a publicly recognized charity that provides essential social services — like an ABC store, he said.
 
  North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper on March 27 issued a stay-at-home order in place until April 29, prohibiting gatherings of 10 or more people and directing North Carolinians to stay at home except for essential activities or businesses, such as grocery shopping, outdoor activity, taking care of others, and working at essential businesses like hospitals.
 Local outlets reported that police said there were about 50 people protesting at the clinic, but Benham said that information is inaccurate. Cities4Life had three members present at the clinic and a mobile ultrasound unit attended by two members, according to Benham, while about 15 police officers were at the scene. (RELATED: ‘Hail Satan’: Students Met With Public Masturbation, Glass Hurled, As They Pray Outside Abortion Clinic)
 “By the time they took me away, there were individuals that came and showed up,” he said. “But there was no organized groups of people. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said there was a cluster, that there were 50 protesters. And of course, none of that is true.”
 Video footage from the incident showed Benham telling a police officer that he and Cities4Life are within their rights to stand outside the clinic, adding that they are practicing social distancing and standing six feet apart.

    David Benham Unlawfully Arrested
 Saturday morning David Benham was unlawfully arrested. Many have labeled him a fake Christian and claimed that he was endangering lives by being out today. This couldn't be further from the truth. David practiced social distancing and exercised every necessary precaution in light of COVID-19. Thank you for all the prayer and support so far. See the whole story in this video.
 Posted by Benham Brothers on Saturday, April 4, 2020
 
 “We are practicing social distancing, we have cleaned our hands, we are offering help to these mothers,” Benham told the police officers in the video.
 He told the DCNF that Cities4Life took multiple precautions against the virus, including drawing on the sidewalk to mark appropriate distances for the sidewalk counselors.
 He continued: “And if you are saying that we don’t have the right to be here, then go in the abortion clinic and make the arrests there.”
 “I don’t have the authority to go in the abortion clinic,” the police officer said. (RELATED: World Health Organization: Abortion Is ‘Essential’ During Coronavirus Pandemic)
 “So you don’t have the authority to go into the abortion clinic, but you have the authority to bully us and our sidewalk counselors?” Benham asked the officer.
 “I’m not budging,” he added. “And our sidewalk counselors are not budging.”
 “You know I am well within my constitutional authority to be here,” Benham said, as he was handcuffed. “You know that we are doing the right thing.”
 The video footage showed Benham telling the officers that he and the other sidewalk counselors are acting within their constitutional rights to be there, and that the group is a recognized charity “offering essential services” within the law to assist women in at-risk situations.
 “I’m actually thankful that when I got tapped on the shoulder, I didn’t even hesitate and just did it,” Benham told the DCNF of his arrest. “Then I felt courage inside of me and I felt a real pain in my heart for my country, and I felt a real threat to my children’s future.”
 “And you’ll see on the video, when they cuffed me, I said something and I almost burst out crying. I swallowed it back because I was just hit with such emotion that I can’t believe my country is doing this. I can’t believe these officers,” he said. “And it wasn’t the officers. It’s whoever’s instructing the officers. I can’t believe we’ve gotten to this point where we’re going to use a national healthcare emergency, a global healthcare emergency and global healthcare crisis to grab on unlimited power of the government and steal constitutional rights from pro-life Christians.”
 Benham was booked and released four hours later, he said, with an upcoming court date of June 2. He and seven others were charged with Violation of Emergency Prohibitions and Restrictions, according to WBTV.
 “I was already in jail — just the holding tank — for about an hour. And then all of a sudden I look up and boom, here comes my 20-year-old with cuffs on,” Benham said.
 “I said, ‘What on earth happened?’ He was like, ‘Well, you know, I wasn’t even standing around anyone and they told me I had to leave and there wasn’t even 10 people there.’ And so I was like, ‘Well, I might as well go down and like my dad.'”
 Benham said the incident showed “viewpoint discrimination” from the mayor of Charlotte, the city council members of Charlotte, and the city attorney of Charlotte.
 “They’ve been after us for years,” he said. “Against conservative voices.”
 “So once this coven crisis hit, this was their opportunity for a power grab,” he added.
 Benham pointed the DCNF toward a March 28 tweet from Charlotte City Councilwoman Julie Eiselt in which she asked police to shut down pro-life activity at an abortion clinic. Eiselt, who did not respond to a request for comment from the DCNF, noted in another tweet that pro-lifers had been protesting at a Planned Parenthood clinic.
  Neither Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles nor the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department replied to multiple requests for comment from the DCNF. (RELATED: Texas Governor Deems Religious Services Essential As Police Arrest Southern Pastors For Holding Sunday Services)
 Benham noted that the police understood “very clearly” that Cities4Life had the right to be at the clinic.
 “They had one of their officers on the phone with their attorney,” he said. “And so every argument I was making, they would then make that argument to their attorney and then come back with what they were trying to say. And every time we just twisted them right up and said, ‘Nope, Nope. Doesn’t work. Here’s why.'”
 “They should have never made that arrest,” he added. “They should’ve never done it. But they did.”
 Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz defended Benham in a Saturday tweet, calling the arrest “unconstitutional.”
 “My friend David Benham was unconstitutionally arrested today in NC for peacefully providing pregnancy counseling outside an abortion clinic. If NC deems abortion “essential,” then pregnancy care services are as well. This is WRONG; Governor Cooper should be ashamed,” he tweeted.
 “This is an unconstitutional arrest,” Cruz added in another tweet. “@BenhamBrothers exercising core First Amendment rights. PEACEFULLY. In a way fully consistent w/ public safety. Because elected Dems are pro-abortion, they are abusing their power—in a one-sided way—to silence pregnancy counselors.”
 Both Live Action and Live Action’s president Lila Rose weighed in on the matter as well.
  “It is DESPICABLE  unconstitutional for pro-abortion bureaucrats to order the arrest of peaceful Americans who pray  offer hope outside abortion facilities, all while allowing the lethal abortion industry to continue killing innocent children during a pandemic,” Rose tweeted.

retooling a plant in Indiana to manufacture ventilators with Ventec Life Systems.The partnership could increase capacity to more than 10,000 ventilators per month; hospitals confront a critical shortage of ventilators as the COVID-19 coronavirus spreads across the US.GM also said that it would produce surgical masks at a plant in Michigan.Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.



On Friday, President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum directing the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the Defense Production Act to ""accept, perform and prioritize federal contracts"" for ventilators.Trump's move comes after he railed against the automaker on Twitter over the production of the life-saving machines needed to assist medical professionals responding to the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement, the White House accused General Motors of ""wasting time"" and that their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic was too urgent to allow for the give-and-take of the contracting process.GM confirmed that it would build ventilators at a factory in Indiana, in partnership with Ventec Life Systems.The VOCSN critical-care ventilators are FDA-cleared and could begin shipping next month.



""Across all manufacturers, there is a global backorder of critical care ventilators capable of supporting patients fighting COVID-19,"" Ventec said in a statement.""Depending on the needs of the federal government, Ventec and GM are poised to deliver the first ventilators next month and ramp up to a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with the infrastructure and capability to scale further.""Some details about the use of the factory in Indiana were earlier reported by The New York Times.Ventec said that it would also expand manufacturing capacity at its Bothell, Washington, facility.GM and Ventec announced a partnership earlier this week. But on Friday, President Donald Trump attacked GM and CEO Mary Barra for a deal for FEMA to buy ventilators that reportedly fell through.



The companies said that efforts to retool the Kokomo, Indiana, plant, which normally supplies electrical components for vehicles, were underway ""around the clock.""

 ""Depending on the needs of the federal government, Ventec and GM are poised to deliver the first ventilators next month and ramp up to a manufacturing capacity of more than 10,000 critical care ventilators per month with the infrastructure and capability to scale further,"" Ventec said.According to Ventec CEO Chris Kiple, ""This unique partnership combines Ventec's respiratory care expertise with GM's manufacturing might to produce sophisticated and high-quality critical care ventilators.""""This pandemic is unprecedented and so is the response, with incredible support from GM and their suppliers,"" he added. ""Healthcare professionals on the front lines deserve the best tools to treat patients and precision critical care ventilators like VOCSN are what is necessary to save lives.""The companies said that work started last Friday, March 20, on an immediate plan to mass-produce ventilators, locating more than 700 parts required to assemble 200,000 ventilators.



""GM is in the position to help build more ventilators because of the remarkable performance of GM and Ventec's global supply base,"" added Barra. ""Our joint teams have moved mountains to find real solutions to save lives and fight the pandemic.""GM also said that it would start making ""FDA-cleared Level 1 surgical masks at its Warren, Michigan manufacturing facility.""Production starts next week and could create up to 100,000 masks."

(NASDAQ: GILD) is donating 1.5 million doses of remdesivir, its investigational drug for COVID-19, for compassionate use, expanded access and clinical trials, Chairman and CEO Daniel O'Day said Saturday. 
The doses are intended for patients with severe symptoms who will receive them intravenously on a daily basis in a hospital setting, the CEO said in a letter posted on Gilead's website. 
The 1.5 million doses could amount to more than 140,000 treatment courses in COVID-19 patients, depending on the duration of treatment, he said. 
The antiviral drug was first developed by Gilead as a potential treatment for the Ebola and Marburg viruses. Multiple clinical trials for the drug are underway in COVID-19 with thousands of patients worldwide participating, the company's CEO said Saturday. 
The drug is investigational and unapproved, and its safety and efficacy are not yet known, according to Gilead.
""Having a potential treatment in our hands comes with significant responsibility,"" O'Day said. 
""Providing our existing supplies at no charge is the right thing to do, to facilitate access to patients as quickly as possible and in recognition of the public emergency posed by this pandemic.""

Gilead Sets Goal Of Producing 1M More Remdesivir Doses This Year
As of Sunday, there are 1,252,265 confirmed coronavirus cases globally and 68,147 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data. 238,675 people have recovered from the virus, according to the university. 
Over 1,700 patients have been treated programs where Gilead has provided remdesivir on a compassionate use basis for children and pregnant women, O'Day said. 
The company has set a goal of producing more than 500,000 remdesivir treatment courses by October and 1 million by the end of 2020.
The production of the drug requires specialized chemistry, multiple chemical reactions, scarce raw materials and sterile manufacturing capabilities, the CEO said. Gilead has managed to cut the end-to-end manufacturing timeline for remdesivir from about one year to roughly six months, he said.

Over the weekend, new coronavirus cases continued to rise in major centers around the world, albeit at an at least temporarily slower pace than in recent weeks.
The state of New York, which leads the nation with about 122,000 positive cases, on Sunday reported 594 new coronavirus deaths, or a decrease from the 630 reported on Saturday. But Governor Andrew Cuomo in Sunday press briefing cautioned against conflating the state’s first reported decrease in both death and total case count with the start of a trend, and reiterated that the state health system remains strained with patients. Total fatalities in New York have topped 4,100 to date.
Elsewhere, Italy reported the slowest rise of new deaths in two weeks on Sunday. France and Spain – two other European centers for the virus – also reported a deceleration in new deaths. In Britain, where more than 47,000 people have been infected, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to a hospital for further testing 10 days after testing positive for the coronavirus.
Official government guidance around controlling the spread of the coronavirus continues to be dynamic in the U.S., with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday adding a recommendation for Americans to wear cloth face coverings when leaving their homes.
And U.S. leaders’ rhetoric around the outbreak is still dire, with many Americans in states across the country preparing to remain under stay-in-place orders for at least the coming weeks.
On Sunday, U.S. Surgeon General Vice Admiral Jerome Adams told Fox News on Sunday that this coming week “is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives, quite frankly,” adding that it will be “our Pearl Harbor moment.” He also noted in the interview, however, that Americans could “change the trajectory of this epidemic” by following social distancing guidelines.
And for equity markets, visibility as to the duration and extent of the outbreak would be a welcomed respite. Stocks ended last week lower as volatility returned to equity markets following the prior week’s advances, as rapidly deteriorating economic data began to reflect the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The March jobs report – which collected data just through about the 12th of the month – already showed U.S. employers cut 701,000 non-farm payrolls, before widespread social distancing measures had even gone into effect.
With this in mind, Thursday’s initial jobless claims report will again be a closely watched print, with consensus economists expecting to see 5 million new unemployment claims filed for the week ended April 4. The prior week, jobless claims skyrocketed to a record 6.648 million.

6:18 p.m. ET Sunday: Boeing extends closure of Puget Sound, Washington operations
Boeing (BA) said in an announcement Sunday that it is extending the production facility closures at its Puget Sound, Washington-area facilities, “in light of the company's continuing focus on the health and safety of employees, current assessment of the spread of COVID-19 in Washington state, the reliability of the supply chain and additional recommendations from government health authorities.”
Previously, Boeing had anticipated a 14-day temporary suspension of these facilities in Washington state, starting March 25. At the time, Boeing said it would grant paid leave to employees who could not work from home for 10 days. Boeing did not provide an update on its leave policy in its latest public announcement Sunday.

Oil Retreats as Meeting Delay Raises Doubts for Price War Truce,2020-04-05 23:55:39+00:00,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-retreats-doubts-surface-potential-221100280.html,[],16,0,"['Truce', 'Doubts', 'Delay', 'Price', 'producer Saudi', 'agreement', 'market', 'Crude', 'demand', 'meeting', 'barrel', 'prices', 'Saudi', 'producers', 'Russia', 'OPEC', 'Brent', 'coronavirus', 'Friday', 'futures', 'Bloomberg', 'oil', 'Riyadh', 'commodities', 'ANZ Bank', 'Saudi Aramco', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'Moscow', 'Asia', 'International Energy Agency', 'New York', 'market share', 'Donald Trump', 'West Texas Intermediate', 'WTI', 'Singapore', 'oil industry', 'Brent crude', '#FuturesContract', '#GunBarrel', '#BloombergLP', '#OPEC', '#OPEC', '#Russia', '#Petroleum', '#Coronavirus', '#WestTexasIntermediate', '#Asia', '#SaudiArabia', '#DonaldTrump', '#SaudiAramco', '#InternationalEnergyAgency', '#PetroleumIndustry', '#Commodity', '#AustraliaAndNewZealandBankingGroup', '#BrentCrude', '#Singapore', '#NewYork', '#WTI', '#Riyadh', '#Moscow', '#MarketShare']","(Bloomberg) -- Crude fell sharply in Asia after a delay to a planned meeting of top producers to discuss output curbs raised doubts over the prospects for an agreement.
Brent futures dropped as much as 12%, after jumping almost 14% on Friday. The OPEC+ bloc including Russia will hold a virtual gathering on April 9 instead of Monday after fresh divisions emerged. Saudi Arabia and Russia have indicated that they want the U.S. to join any agreement, but President Donald Trump had only hostile words for OPEC on Saturday, and threatened tariffs on foreign oil.
State oil producer Saudi Aramco has delayed until Thursday an announcement on its official selling prices for May, according to people with knowledge of the situation, to await signs of what may happen at the meeting. That comes as the International Energy Agency said that the deepest production cuts in the oil industry’s history wouldn’t be enough to steady a crude market in which demand has been ravaged by the coronavirus.
“The likelihood of a deal being done is extremely low,” said Daniel Hynes, senior commodities strategist at ANZ Bank. “Certainly the type of agreement you’d need to stabilize the market is a long shot given how much demand had been hit.”
Brent crude fell $2.14 a barrel to $31.97 at 6:52 a.m. Singapore time after earlier dropping to as low as $30.03. The contract’s six-month contango widened to $5.58 a barrel from $3.96 on Friday.
West Texas Intermediate futures in New York declined 7.3% to $26.28 a barrel after earlier dropping as much as 11%.
Brent futures rallied 37% last week, while WTI ended the week up 32%, as Riyadh and Moscow appeared to move toward a resolution to their damaging battle for market share. Prices are still less than half the levels at the start of the year, with the coronavirus crisis crushing demand.

""You were the one who early on objected to the travel restrictions with China,"" Navarro reportedly told Fauci.

There's no evidence Fauci has ever publicly criticized the administration's approach to travel from China amid the outbreak, and on March 12 Fauci praised such a policy during a press briefing.

Trump officials including the president himself have touted the possibility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for coronavirus, though the drug is not proven to be effective according to Fauci himself during a recent press conference.

""The answer is no,"" he said in late March, adding: ""And the evidence that you're talking about ... is anecdotal evidence.""

""There has never been a confrontation in the task force meetings like the one yesterday,"" one source familiar with Fauci and Navarro's dispute told Axios. ""People speak up and there's robust debate, but there's never been a confrontation. Yesterday was the first confrontation.""

In a Twitter video, Cook outlined Apple’s efforts to assist the heroic healthcare professionals on the frontlines fighting the coronavirus pandemic.



The first shipment of face shields went to Kaiser facilities in the Santa Clara Valley earlier this week, Cook said. Apple said that by the end of this coming week, it will have shipped over one million face shields and will ship another million the week after.

Apple is working with governments at all levels in a “truly global effort” to get the over 20 million sourced masks to places of the greatest need, Cook said. He added that teams across Apple, such as design, operations, engineering and packaging, are working with suppliers to produce and ship face shields to hospitals.

The materials for the masks and face shields are being sourced from the U.S. and China, where they are also being manufactured. “We hope to quickly expand distribution beyond the U.S.” Cook said.

“For Apple, this is a labor of love and gratitude and we will share more of our efforts over time. In the meantime, each of us can stop the spread of the virus by following expert advice to stay home and practice social distancing,” Cook said.

Kaiser replied to Cook’s video on Twitter, saying, “Thank you @Apple and @Tim_Cook for your incredible contribution in producing and distributing face shields to our Kaiser Permanente caregivers as we face the unprecedented challenge in the fight against COVID-19 #FlattentheCurve“"

Pritzker for allegedly ""complaining all the time"" during Sunday's coronavirus White House press briefing, adding that he ""hasn't performed well"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

""There is a governor, I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker. He is always complaining,"" Trump said after taking the podium. ""I just said, 'give me a list of a couple of the things we've done in Illinois.' We're building a 2,500-bed hospital in McCormick Place, that's a big convention center in Chicago. We're helping to staff it and probably will end up staffing it because he's not able to do what he's supposed to be able to do as the governor.""

""He has not performed well,"" the president added.

Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.

Trump's criticism of Pritzker came hours after the Illinois governor called out the president on CNN's State of the Union for suggesting that states should have prepared their own stockpiles of medical equipment.

""The president does not understand the word federal. Federal Emergency Management Agency. We have a state Emergency Management Agency, but if he were right, why would we ever need a Federal Emergency Management Agency?"" Pritzker said. ""It's because individual states can't possibly do what the federal government can do.""

Trump said some U.S. states were ""totally unprepared"" for the coronavirus pandemic during the White House' COVID-19 press conference on Friday. ""We have a federal stockpile, and they have state stockpiles, and frankly they were, many of the states, they were totally unprepared for this,"" the president said. ""So we had to go into the federal stockpile, but we're not an ordering clerk. They have to have it for themselves.""

In response, Pritzner told CNN that individual states did not have the power to invoke the Defense Production Act that would have allowed them to prepare for such a pandemic, but noted that the Trump administration did.

""There's no way that we can stockpile in anticipation of a pandemic that no one anticipated, and yet the federal government is responsible for doing precisely that,"" the Illinois governor said. ""And we now know that intelligence sources and all the best advice that was given, was given in January and early February to the president and the White House, and they seemed to not have acted at all upon it.""

Prizker also said that if the Trump administration and federal government had invoked the legislation to build ventilators beforehand, then ""we would to have the same problems we have today, and frankly, very many fewer people would die."""

Bottom Line: Every pricing strategy is going through a hard reset from the pandemics’ economic fallout, making data-driven decisions a must-have going forward, starting with stabilizing pricing and margins.
 
Data is the best antidote against fear and panic. It provides guardrails, guidance, and insights that lead to better decision-making and, in the case of pricing, preserving margins. Manufacturers surviving in the chaotic wake of COVID-19’s economic impact began modeling worst-case pricing and volume scenarios in early February. Every one of them began deconstructing their sales pipelines, order backlogs, and negotiating for new order delivery dates, doing the best they can with the applications and tools they have. Of all the levers a company can use to stay profitable, pricing is by far the most powerful. A recent McKinsey study found that a 1% price increase yields a 22% increase in Earnings before Interest  Taxes (EBITDA) margins for distribution-based businesses. The same study found it would take a 7.5% reduction in fixed costs to achieve the corresponding 22% increase in EBITDA that a 1% increase in pricing delivers. The more integrated accounting, finance, production, sales, and service data, the better the pipeline, backlog, order, margin, and revenue decisions every business will be able to make. The more effective the commercial analytics, deal intelligence, and deal price guarantee applications, the more they’re able to choose the best possible pricing strategy during chaotic times.
 
Intelligent Pricing Protects Margins In A Downturn 
 
Being data-driven through a crisis helps alleviate risk, demystifies what the actual revenue and order forecasts are, all leading to fewer pricing missteps in uncertain times. The better the data, the more precise projections of downside risk. Using advanced predictive analytics and machine learning, intelligent pricing can deliver commercial analytics, deal price guidance, and deal intelligence. Think of these three areas of commercial intelligence as part of an intelligence pricing engine continually and dynamically always testing and learning through the use of supervised machine learning algorithms. McKinsey’s recent article, Dynamic pricing: Using digital and analytics to take value pricing in the chemical industry to the next level, provides a framework that illustrates why intelligent pricing is needed today. And while the framework is in a chemical industry-oriented article, its core concepts apply to manufacturing.

Preserving margins and enough profit to keep operating during the pandemic requires an entirely new approach to pricing. Knowing in real-time how supplier costs, delays, and unforeseen events impact revenue is a must-have now. Real-time data integration and the speed it delivers is a must-have feature of any pricing system to take on and overcome the many challenges this pandemic has created. Having an intelligent pricing strategy that can quickly interpret, recommend, and act on pricing and margin insights will save more companies in this pandemic than the severest price cuts ever will. 
 
 
The ideal intelligent pricing system would support real-time integration to ERP, CRM, pricing, and service systems and be built on a solid price management, dynamic pricing, and discount and rebate management platform. Personalizing offers and quoting via machine learning would need to be available across every selling and service channel.

What Matters Most When Pricing In A Pandemic 
 
Realize everyone is dealing with a hard revenue reset right now, and the need for demystifying sales pipelines, orders, and backlog is shared across nearly every business affected by the pandemic. After speaking with almost a dozen U.S.-based manufacturers over the last week to see how the pandemic is impacting their business, I learned the following:
 
 
 
 Set hard price floors for customers, segments, by SKU (Stocking Unit), vendor, product collection, and segment. Weighing transaction speed or the time it takes to release a sales hold on a price quote versus margin leakage needs to be considered when hard price floors are set. It’s also a good idea to define eligibility flags which customer, product, vendor, or segment prices are eligible for price exceptions that are sent to sales and senior management for approval. 
 
 Price wars waste margins, and do you want a customer who only buys on price anyway? It’s time to quit any deal where there’s a price war going on now and save the margin. Besides, if you’re quoting to a customer who wants to drive your price to the floor or lower, would you take their business in better times? No. Let them go to competitors who are willing to sacrifice margin. 
 
 Support the five most-proven sales strategies emerging out of this pandemic with more flexible pricing to match how your customers want to buy. Cross-sell, upsell, renewals, win back, and new customers are the five most proven selling strategies during the pandemic based on last months’ manufacturing sales. When defining cross-sell and upsell sales strategies, taking into account how offers and pricing can be personalized to the offer level is proving effective today. Bundling in services and transitioning win-backs to subscription-based models that may be more affordable today is also working. New customer wins are still happening, driven by improved deal pricing guidance.
 
 Using Configure, Price, Quote (CPQ) as a single console for managing pricing while achieving greater enforcement and guidance is a must-do in these times. Achieving greater pricing enforcement and guidance across all sales channels starts with CPQ being the central hub or reference system for price execution. It’s easier to manage product mix decisions and personalize pricing offers by customer, segment, channel, and product. It’s also an excellent way to get warnings or alerts of potential churn and risk detection by customer of low purchasing – all invaluable data to have during a pandemic."

Futures pointed to a mixed open for Japanese stocks. The Nikkei futures contract in Chicago was at 18,110 while its counterpart in Osaka was at 17,700. That compared against the Nikkei 225's last close at 17,820.19.

Meanwhile, shares in Australia were set to open little changed. The SPI futures contract was at 5,079, as compared to the S&P/ASX 200's last close at 5,067.50.

Markets in China are closed on Monday for Qingming, a tomb sweeping festival.

Investor focus on Monday will likely be on oil prices after a scheduled meeting between OPEC and its allies — collectively referred to as OPEC+ — was pushed back, raising fears that a production cut might face challenges.

Oil prices plunged in the morning of Asian hours, with international benchmark Brent crude futures down 6.3% to $31.96 per barrel. U.S. crude futures also dropped 7.7% to $26.15 per barrel.

The moves came after both Brent and U.S. crude futures surged last week to their best week on record as Saudi Arabia called for a OPEC+ meeting, signalling there could be progress on a production cut. But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia escalated on Friday, and the meeting will now ""likely"" be held on Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The organization's March meeting ended with no deal after Russia rejected Riyadh's proposed output cut that had been made in a bid to prop up falling oil prices as the coronavirus outbreak sapped demand. This kicked off a price war between the two powerhouse producers."

US crude, meanwhile, fell as much as 8.5% on Sunday to trade around $26 a barrel, and Brent crude — the global benchmark — also fell more than 6%.

The drop in oil comes after OPEC and Russia on Saturday postponed a meeting to discuss supply cuts and an end to the price war. The meeting had been set for Monday, but is now scheduled for Thursday, an OPEC source told CNN.

Saudi Arabia and Russia have been locked in an epic price war since early March when the OPEC+ oil alliance cracked, flooding the oil market with cheap crude, just as demand cratered because of the coronavirus pandemic . Crude has crashed to 18-year lows, crushing American oil companies and energy stocks. The broader US stock market ended last week lower after a worse-than-expected jobs report for March. The US economy lost 701,000 jobs during the month — the worst report since 2009 and the first time in a decade the economy lost more jobs than it gained."

Jay Inslee decried the surgeon general's comments on Sunday comparing the anticipated swell in the coronavirus crisis to Pearl Harbor in light of the President's prior comments on qualifying federal support to states struggling to fight the outbreak .

""Can you imagine if Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, 'I'll be right behind you, Connecticut, good luck building those battleships'?"" Inslee told NBC on Sunday. ""Look, we need a national mobilization of the manufacturing base of the United States as we'd started on December 8, 1941.""

Earlier on Sunday, Surgeon General Jerome Adams predicted that this week would be the ""hardest and the saddest"" for ""most Americans' lives,"" describing the upcoming period of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States as ""our Pearl Harbor moment.""

Inslee, a Democrat, called it ""ludicrous that we don't have a national effort in this, to say 'we're a back up,'"" appearing to reference President Donald Trump's repeated comments that the federal stockpile should serve as ""a backup"" to states' reserves.

Inslee's comments come as governors , struggling to outfit frontline workers with personal protective equipment and ventilators as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to climb, have experienced varying success in securing federal aid

The Washington state governor, who ran for the Democratic nomination for president last year, called for invoking the Defense Production Act, which gives the government more control during emergencies to direct industrial production, ""so that we can get these companies, instead of making cupholders, start making visors, start making test kits"" -- a scarce resource in many states, he added.

Inslee said that he and governors of both stripes ""have been urging the President to do what he should.""

""If he wants to be a wartime President, be a wartime President,"" Inslee added. ""Show some leadership, mobilize the industrial base in the United States -- that's what we need."""

Wilson was filmed singing ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" by her 24-year-old son Truman Hanks from their Los Angeles home, according to announcers Mike Joy and Jeff Gordon who led Sunday's broadcast of NASCAR's third virtual race.

Ever since the coronavirus suspended NASCAR's races last month, drivers have been competing against each other virtually using race simulators, which are similar to what you'd see in an arcade racing game. The races have been broadcast on Fox Sports, bringing in more than 1 million viewers, according to Nielsen.

The fact that Wilson was the one to sing the national anthem appeared to offer some hope to NASCAR fans during these difficult times.

""Beautifully done! Thanks for a small glimmer of hope, seeing and hearing you feeling better, Ms. Wilson,"" one fan commented. ""Excellent job. When we do get back to real racing, she should be invited to sing again,"" another commented. Wilson and her husband, actor Tom Hanks, announced that they were diagnosed with coronavirus on March 11 while they were in Australia. They have since returned to the US and are carrying on ""sheltering in place and social distancing,"" according to Hanks' tweet last Saturday. Wilson reflected on several life milestones in an Instagram post last Sunday. She talked about being a survivor of breast cancer, and now, a ""COVID 19 survivor."" ""Please take a moment today to acknowledge the amazing creation your bodies are and to thank it for doing so much,"" Wilson said in her post."

Trump told a White House briefing that over the last 24 hours the federal government has delivered an additional 500 ventilators to New Jersey, which is among the hardest-hit states. He said they have also sent 200 ventilators to Louisiana and 300 to Michigan. Another 600 have gone to Illinois, he said, while Massachusetts will be getting 100.

The ventilator disbursements come as governors have clamored for weeks for the Trump administration to do more to confront the shortage of the crucially needed machines, which allow seriously ill coronavirus patients to breathe.

New York and Louisiana have both warned in particular that they do not have enough ventilators for the coming onslaught.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said earlier Sunday on CNN that his state had received 200 ventilators from the federal government but still expected to run out on April 9.

The ventilator announcement comes as federal officials are warning that the coming week will be particularly bad, as the peak of cases nears, especially in hot spots like New York.

“This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans’ lives,” Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on Fox News Sunday.

Trump, who has bashed several governors repeatedly, instead offered some positive words on Sunday.

He praised Washington Gov.

Still, when mentioning the ventilators going to Illinois, Trump noted, “there's a governor, I hear him complaining all the time, Pritzker.”

Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker (D) kept up his criticism of the Trump administration earlier Sunday for not fully using the Defense Production Act to direct businesses to ramp up production of needed supplies and coordinate where they will go. States have said they are now in a bidding war with each other because of a lack of federal leadership.

“The president does not understand the word federal,” Pritzker said on CNN on Sunday, adding: “individual states can't possibly do what the federal government can do.”"

Over the years, Melba's became a bustling neighborhood fixture, serving American comfort food.

 

But three weeks ago, the novel coronavirus pandemic took Wilson and her staff off course. Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered all New York City restaurants to close down or switch their business to takeout and delivery only. For Wilson and her staff, that order was life changing; 24 employees were laid off, and Wilson says the impact has been severe.

 

""I think we're grieving our lives as we knew it,"" Wilson told Scott Pelley. ""It's like an ongoing death. It's an ongoing grieving period. And the scary thing is we don't know when it's going to end.""

 

Wilson says she fears for the wellbeing of staff who are now unemployed, and those fears keep her up at night. ""I'm concerned about Champ, who is in his seventies,"" she said. ""I worry about Josh, one of our busboys who just found out that his girlfriend is expecting. I worry about Mohammed, who is a phenomenal cook, whose family depends on him to send money back home to Africa.""

 

Melba's is one of the 27,000 restaurants in New York City fighting for survival on takeout and delivery alone. Full-service restaurants employ over 300,000 workers in the city. Many restaurant owners, like Wilson, are hoping a federal economic stimulus package will provide some relief. But Wilson doesn't know when that relief will come or how long it will last. ""We're hoping that's going to kick in and ease some of the burden. But for how long?""

 

""I personally think that they should forgive rents for the time that we're mandated to close,"" Wilson said. ""When you look at over 300,000 employees that are out of work, that's a huge number. And we are truly the economic engine of our communities."""

“But God has his own plan,” says Rev. Malachi Van Tassell, the university’s president.

So much about the extraordinary life of Maurice Stokes must be explained, if it is to be explained at all, by those six simple words. He was a brilliant college player at St. Francis, the first player to win the MVP at the NIT from a team that didn’t win the tournament (in 1955), culminating a year in which he averaged 27.1 points and 26.2 rebounds.

He was the NBA’s rookie of the year in 1956 for the Rochester Royals, became an All-Star when that franchise moved to Cincinnati, averaged 16.4 points and 17.3 rebounds and was well on his way, at age 24, to becoming one of the greatest players in the league’s history.


But on March 12, 1958, Stokes fell and banged his head in the Royals’ regular-season finale. A few days later, on a small plane ride home from Detroit for a playoff game, he took ill. By the time he reached the hospital he was fully paralyzed, diagnosed with post-traumatic encephalopathy.

He would regain some motor skills over the years through intense physical therapy but suffered a heart attack and died on April 6, 1970, two months shy of his 37th birthday. His funeral was held at St. Francis and he is buried on campus, in the Franciscan Friar Cemetery, one of only a few lay people given their eternal rest there.

It is one of the heartbreaking stories in the history of American sports, but also one of the most redeeming, too, thanks to Stokes’ friendship with Jack Twyman. Twyman was a fellow all-star on the Royals and though the two men weren’t especially close, Stokes’ accident changed that. Twyman lived year-round in Cincinnati. Stokes’ family was in Pittsburgh. Soon after Stokes’ diagnosis, Twyman agreed to become Stokes’ legal guardian.

What followed was one of the extraordinary friendships ever formed.

One day, Jack was asked why he’d decided to make such a remarkable commitment to Maurice, and again he shrugged his shoulders and said, “Maurice needed someone. I became that someone.”

That phrase — “Become That Someone” — all these years later, has become St. Francis’ motto. And though St. Francis had to postpone its celebration of Stokes’ life, it is a message that has never seemed more relevant than it does in these turbulent, uncertain days.

“During this pandemic it’s a call for each person to become their best self,” Father Van Tassell says. “We can become that someone in any number of scenarios.”


Tim Frank was hoping to be a part of the celebration. Frank is the NBA’s senior vice president for basketball communications and he is from Altoona, Pa., less than a half-hour from St. Francis. He grew up believing Stokes was larger than life, watched Red Flash basketball games in the fieldhouse named for Stokes, looked at his retired No. 26 in the rafters there.

One of the saddest elements of Stokes’ story is that he played in the league so briefly, and even among many basketball fans his is a name that often draws blank stares. The NBA did its part to rectify that eight years ago when it created the Twyman-Stokes Award to recognize the league’s teammate of the year.

It is a poignant trophy — one figurine helping another to its feet — and the winners, who have included Chauncey Billups, Tim Duncan and Vince Carter, are invariably honored at first and then completely humbled once they read up on the award’s namesakes.

“It’s so gratifying to see that,” Frank says. “More people should know about Maurice, and more people should know about the amazing friendship he had with Jack. Especially now. This is a story that resonates.”

It does. It should. We lean on friends now as much as we ever have, more even, as much as Maurice and Jack leaned on each other. Once, late in his life, Maurice’s intense rehab yielded a small victory: he was able to regain a little flexibility in his fingers. It took him a few hours, but he finally completed his first sentence. He showed it to his friend:

“Dear Jack, how can I ever thank you?”

To which Jack immediately, and quintessentially, replied: “You may think I come here to cheer you up. But, really, it’s the other way around.”"

Some lose less, some lose a lot more when it comes to major league teams during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Orioles lose less. They were going to have trouble drawing spectators this year. They get to run time off the horrible contracts of Alex Cobb and, especially, Chris Davis without paying them. No one of too much significance is accruing service time toward arbitration or free agency while games are not played.

The Tigers are in a similar situation, just substitute Jordan Zimmermann and Miguel Cabrera for Cobb and Davis while acknowledging that service time accruing for Matt Boyd is somewhat hurtful.

On the other side, the Dodgers are oft mentioned for being particularly hurt by games being missed and perhaps a season lost to the virus. That revolves mainly around one player — Mookie Betts. He is due to be a free agent following the 2020 season regardless and now may never play a game for the Dodgers after they traded three prospects to Boston for him, plus redirected Kenta Maeda to Minnesota.

But the Dodgers have the young talent and resources to remain a powerhouse even without the prospects or Betts. The lost revenue in the sport likely will drive down free-agent prices at least for the near future, and just a few teams, such as the Dodgers and Yankees, might have the finances to capitalize.

For the Yankees, though, part of the tolerance to stretch to nine years at $324 million for Gerrit Cole was knowing, yeah, they likely would be overpaying over the last few seasons of the contract, but they also would be getting prime years early. Now, Cole’s final season in his 20s is tick, tick, ticking away without games.

Still, the Yankees have talent and resources and — like the Dodgers — a baseball operations department that knows how to assemble a winning team.

The biggest losers are clubs that have pushed so much into the pot for this year or next and do not have strong feeder systems or the financial wherewithal to best withstand things if most or, especially all, of the 2020 major league season is lost. The three that stand out are the Cubs, Reds and Mets.

Mets GM Brodie Van WagenenCharles Wenzelberg/New York Post
The Cubs marketed their best players, such as Kris Bryant and Willson Contreras, in the offseason recognizing they needed to spread payroll around more and deepen their stock of controllable talent. But the Cubs never traded those players, who had two years of service time until free agency. So now, as their control is dwindling even as no games are being played, their value is lower, especially because more teams will lack the revenue to want to take on expensive players.

Cubs president of baseball operations Theo Epstein told me last month the team would decide by the trade deadline if it could win a title and, if not, would be realistic about moving players. Will there even be a trade deadline now with the Cubs facing the core of a champion — Bryant, Contreras, Javy Baez, Jon Lester, Anthony Rizzo and Kyle Schwarber — with expiring contracts after this season or next?

The Reds already gave away two of their better prospects (Jeter Downs and Josiah Gray) to get out of Homer Bailey’s pact last year, and the Dodgers already used Downs as a key to get Betts. The Reds also used touted prospect Taylor Trammell last July to get Trevor Bauer when they weren’t really contenders just so they would have him in his walk year this season. Now, what walk season?

Cincinnati gave matching four-year, $64 million free-agent pacts to Nick Castellanos and Mike Moustakas to try to win now. Would you bet on either aging well? Part of the calculus was at least they had 2020 with those guys to try to end a postseason drought that extends to 2013.

But the Mets might be the big losers. Let us count the ways:

They traded key prospects Jarred Kelenic, Justin Dunn, Anthony Kay and Simeon Woods Richardson for Robinson Cano, Edwin Diaz and Marcus Stroman, and they did not make the playoffs last year. Stroman, like Bauer, was obtained with his 2020 walk year in mind. So either he will pitch less in his walk year or become a free agent without pitching at all.


The trade with the Mariners, already looking disastrous with Kelenic growing into a top prospect while Cano and Diaz faltered last year, can only be revived if the Mets receive a lot out of Cano and Diaz. As one NL executive said of what missing games does to that Mets’ trade: “It takes an egregious screwup and makes it worse.”

Like Bryant and Contreras, Michael Conforto, Steven Matz and Noah Syndergaard all will be free agents after next season, and the Mets are now losing shrinking time with them. Syndergaard was going to miss this season one way or another after needing Tommy John surgery. But, again, like the Cubs with Bryant and Contreras, the Mets have missed their best window to trade Syndergaard and recoup some of the controllable inventory lost in the Cano, Diaz and Stroman deals.

Also, with no Syndergaard and with Stroman, Rick Porcello and Michael Wacha free agents, the Mets’ rotation to begin 2021 is Jacob deGrom and Matz — and Matz can leave the following offseason. The strength of the team is about to not be that.

DeGrom turns 32 in June. Like Cole with the Yankees, the Mets just don’t want to lose out on any of deGrom’s peak.

One reason the Mets could tolerate some expense and bad contracts is players such as Pete Alonso, Jeff McNeil and J.D. Davis were not yet arbitration eligible. The Mets wasted a cheap season of that trio last year and another could be flitting away now.

If there is a season, the good-faith understanding between the union and MLB is that an attempt will be made to play as many games as possible. That likely will necessitate adding doubleheaders and perhaps removing off days. I would argue that the Mets’ best 1-through-15 are as good as or better than that of any NL team except the Dodgers. And Brodie Van Wagenen has made the Mets a bit deeper than in recent seasons — especially in the bullpen if Dellin Betances is healthy, and Diaz and Jeurys Familia rebound (which was going to be key even in a 162-game campaign).

But depth is still an issue made worse already by the loss of Syndergaard. If teams are going to need to play more games in an abbreviated period, depth is going to be more vital than ever, and depth is not a Mets stength.

One way to create depth if there is a partial 2020 season is to capitalize on an unfortunate situation — that many teams bereft of revenue might have to move contracts even for middling return. But does anyone see the Mets adding to their payroll? Whenever I ask officials around the sport which teams are in the worst financial situation, the Mets routinely come up because they have so much debt and already were going to lose a lot trying to win in 2020. Now, also the value of a franchise the Wilpons are trying to sell may be plummeting.

Might the Wilpons feel with Steve Cohen, like the Cubs with Bryant and Contreras, that their best chance to receive the most for assets — in this case a franchise — came and went in the offseason?

What could financial distress mean for the near future? The Mets can get out of walk-year players such as Stroman, Yoenis Cespedes, Jed Lowrie, Wilson Ramos, Justin Wilson and even any non-insurance payments to David Wright after 2020. But will the lack of revenues this year (even with a partial season, and especially with none) force the Mets to take their 2021 payroll down toward $100 million (or less)?

As one personnel head said, “Their track record is not wanting to spend even in good times.” In which case, can they even make a qualifying offer (roughly $18 million) to Stroman? Would they even tender a contract to Syndergaard (about $10 million) if they thought they were only going to get, say, 15-18 starts from him next year and could not trade him for much more than 25 cents on the dollar?"

Video posted on Facebook shows cops driving up to dozens of mourners, sirens blaring, during a procession near 55th Street and 12th Avenue in Borough Park that was held for 78-year-old Rabbi Meir Rokeach, who reportedly died of COVID-19 on Saturday night.

“This is not six feet” an officer in a protective face mask says over the loudspeaker, as the members of the Orthodox Jewish community continue to congregate.

The officers then play a recording reminding those gathered to maintain at least a 6-foot distance while in public as a way to stem the spread of the virus.

But the masses of mourners ignored the warnings, though one man was seen approaching the patrol car to apologize.

Hours later, throngs of Hasidic Jews, some in blue face masks, attended another outdoor funeral procession about a mile away near 44th Street and 16th Avenue. Police also responded and asked the congregation to disperse.

At both of the gatherings, the funeral attendees asked for more time to grieve, and cops, “wanting to be respectful because they were in mourning,” gave them about five minutes before starting to play the recording heard in the video, an NYPD spokeswoman said.

The crowds eventually tapered off, she said. There were no arrests or citations issued in either incident.

The events were held just days after another Hasidic Jewish funeral on Avenue N near East 9th Street in Midwood.

Last month, members of New York City’s Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish community openly violated social distancing orders by hosting raucous Brooklyn weddings with hundreds of guests amid the growing spread of the bug.

But since then, community leaders have maintained that social distancing orders are largely being followed with every major synagogue closed, even as Passover approaches this week.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has barred crowds of 50 or more and President Trump has said Americans should avoid events with more than 10 people amid the outbreak, which has infected 64,955 and killed 2,472 in the Big Apple alone as of Sunday evening."

The state’s emergency management director, state police Col. Patrick Callahan, issued an administrative order aimed at hotels, motels, guest houses and private residences.

The additional local authority does not extend to people housed under a state-led shelter effort, to those in temporary residence under emergency or other housing assistance, or to health care workers staying somewhere on a temporary basis.

Gov. Phil Murphy said shore communities have reported people trying to temporarily relocate there from areas hard-hit by the coronavirus spread, but those communities can lack the health care infrastructure that a surge in patients would require.

Sure, there’s no commute, but there’s also no barista, no going out for lunch, no reason to get dressed up. What we’re discovering is that it can be awkward, but also full of heart and, sometimes, even funny.

Lesson 1: Juggling kids and work has never been trickier

Consider what “shelter in place” looks like for 35-year-old Erin Butler and her family in Ho-Ho-Kus, NJ. Butler has climbed the rungs of Citrix’s corporate ladder for the past 14 years, so handling her responsibilities shouldn’t be a problem, even if it’s really busy. (Citrix provides remote digital workspaces, among other things.)

But add a 2- and a 5-year-old, minus the grandparents, who usually help out but are isolating, and you find Butler and her husband waking up to discuss coordinating conference- call schedules as well as creating timetables for feeding, nurturing and entertaining their kids.

When neither is available, they pull out the Little Tikes bounce house. “It can keep them busy for quite a while,” Butler says. Desperate times call for desperate measures.”

With both of them home 24/7, Butler also decided now was a good time to potty train their almost 3-year-old son. His desire to make a big-boy poop came while Dad was on an important call and Mom was in a virtual conference. “What could I do? I hit mute and took him to the bathroom. Thank God I didn’t have the video on,” she says.

Lesson 2: The video conference call is a minefield

One enterprising software salesman would tell us his work-from-home story only if we agreed not to use his real name. The 41-year-old was on a Zoom video call when his partner ran buck naked from the shower to the bedroom. “I was the one speaking. All eyes were on me. There’s no way that my boss and team didn’t notice the nudity,” he says.

But “Jones” went on with the call as if nothing had happened, which is exactly the right thing to do, says etiquette coach Maggie Adams.

“There’s no need to put others in an awkward situation,” she says.

Life coach Marie Singer, from Florham Park, NJ, says there’s no need to get too upset about something like this. “Everyone is working from home and staying in place; it is an unnatural situation,” she says. “All kinds of unusual and unpredictable things are going to happen.”

Suzy Shugg, CEO of Teleplus Healthcare and clinical lipid specialist at NJ Cardiology Associates, discovered this to be true while working from home and caring for her husband, who had COVID-19.

Shugg had taken one of the few gaps in her schedule to jump into the shower before a conference call that she believed was audio-only. When she joined it half-dressed and looked at her computer screen, she was shocked — the camera was on and pointed at her crotch.

“There was the lower half of my body covered only by bright pink underwear,” she says. She grabbed a blanket, adjusted the camera and rejoined the conversation as if nothing had happened. Although at first she was alarmed, “I now think it’s funny,” says Shugg. “There’s other stuff going on if you want to get upset.”

And no, the answer isn’t to turn off the camera for group calls — it implies that you’re doing something else and don’t think the others on the call are worth your undivided attention, says Adams.

Lesson 3: Finding your own space is key

Lynn Smith, anchor of CNN’s 10 a.m. program “On the Story,” always thought that working from home in her profession was impossible. The pandemic has proven her wrong. Now she is doing her show from her home’s “basement bureau” via her phone and some bright lights.

On weekday mornings, just before 8:50 a.m., Smith tells her 4-year-old son that it’s time to go outside for recess (or to the garage if it’s inclement weather) before she starts work. Her husband or their au pair watches him and their other 1-year-old son while they play.

“Sometimes they send me texts while I’m doing the show, asking if they can come in the house yet,” says Smith.

She spends time with the boys after the show, but before retreating to her closet to make phone calls, interview and write scripts for the next day. “It’s the only place in the house that is quiet,” she says.

There is an upside, though. “Usually, I leave the house around 4 a.m.,” she says. “Now I’m here when everyone wakes up. It’s nice.”

Charly Rok, a vice president at Edelman, takes it all in stride. She’s been answering phone calls while sitting on the bathroom floor or in her building’s stairwell. “My husband and I both have loud voices, and we live in a loft,” she says.

Lesson 4: You need to have a bit of give and take

Some space-sharers have created an imaginary co-worker to blame things on. Why fight with your roommate or significant other about empty coffee pots, dirty mugs left in the sink or the printer being out of ink when you can blame Jim, that lazy old slug?

And sometimes, the rest of the household needs some downtime regardless of your schedule. Jennifer Barish, an office manager at Woodbury, NY-based small business loan provider Lendio, now works from her aunt and uncle’s kitchen table in Lindenhurst, NY.

On March 26, her uncle and cousin spent the afternoon in the living room celebrating baseball’s opening day — taped from a previous year, that is — complete with Mets jerseys, hot dogs and general ballpark revelry.

“I love baseball,” she says, reckoning her employer would understand even if her full attention wasn’t on her work.

Says Singer: “For now, we all have to be flexible.”"

Manchester City defender Kyle Walker apologized Sunday and faces disciplinary action from the team after he reportedly defied lockdown conditions by throwing a tawdry party amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Sun reported that he held a party involving two sex workers at his home last week, breaking the British government’s rules on social distancing. The country has been in the middle of a three-week lockdown due to coronavirus.

“I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week which have resulted in a story today (Sunday) about my private life in a tabloid newspaper,” Walker said in a statement. “I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. As such, I want to apologize to my family, friends, football club, supporters and the public for letting them down.
“My actions in this matter are in direct contrast to what I should have been doing regarding the lockdown,” Walker added. “I want to reiterate the message: Stay home, stay safe.”
Manchester City, one of the English Premier League’s top clubs, announced it will look into Walker’s conduct.

The club put out a statement regarding the incident:
“Manchester City FC are aware of a story in a tabloid newspaper regarding the private life of Kyle Walker in relation to a breach of the UK lockdown and social distancing rules. Footballers are global role models, and our staff and players have been working to support the incredible efforts of the NHS (National Health Service) and other key workers in fighting the effects of the COVID-19 coronavirus, in any way we can. Kyle’s actions in this matter have directly contravened these efforts.
“We are disappointed to hear the allegations, note Kyle’s swift statement and apology, and will be conducting an internal disciplinary procedure in the coming days.”

Thomas Metzmacher had to get creative to keep his business open in Germany during the coronavirus pandemic.
After toying with the idea of a delivery service, he instead turned his half-timbered restaurant in Frankfurt into a makeshift drive-thru.
“The restaurant had to close, nobody was allowed to sit inside anymore, so it was either give up or fight,” he said. “I decided to fight.”
Metzmacher was faced with the prospect of having to shut down his traditional German restaurant specializing in a traditional tart hard cider because of German regulations prohibiting groups of people from gathering amid the pandemic.

Now he has been serving up schnitzel, fried potatoes and other German favorites — of course, the tasty Aeppelwoi cider — to customers waiting in a long line of cars.

Late last year — long before most people had heard of the new coronavirus now sweeping the globe — scientists in Germany jumped into action to develop a test for the virus that originated in China.
They had one by mid-January — and labs around the country were ready to start using it just weeks later, around the same time that Europe’s most populous country registered its first case.
“It was clear that if the epidemic swept over here from China, then we had to start testing,” said Hendrik Borucki, a spokesman for Bioscientia Healthcare, which has operated 19 labs in Germany.
That quick work stood in stark contrast to delays and missteps in some other countries. “The reason why we in Germany have so few deaths at the moment compared to the number of infected can be largely explained by the fact that we are doing an extremely large number of lab diagnoses,” said virologist Dr. Christian Drosten, whose team developed the first test for the new virus at Berlin’s Charité hospital — established over 300 years ago to treat plague victims.

Metzmacher’s Zum Lahmen Esel restaurant, which has been in operation since 1807, meanwhile, normally would seat 200 people inside and another 200 in an outdoor garden.
Now, cars have driven up to a small booth in front of the restaurant, where one of Metzmacher’s 36 employees took each order before pushing a plastic tub down a makeshift slide to the car’s window to take payment at a safe distance. Driving ahead, customers would get their orders in another tub pushed to their window.
“It’s going great,” Metzmacher said. “My regulars are supporting me, they’re really happy I’m open.”
CORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Without people sticking around for a few more of the signature ciders, profit margins have been low -- but Metzmacher said it’s better than nothing.
“At least we’re carrying on and we’re continuing to work,” he said.

to experts to bolster their reputation.The coronavirus crisis underscored the need for internal communications, which will remain important.Click here for more BI Prime stories.



The coronavirus pandemic will ravage some public relations firms and benefit others in the short term, but the effects of this crisis will be felt far into the future.Art Stevens, managing partner of The Stevens Group, a mergers and acquisitions consultancy focused on the PR industry, said clients focused on hard-hit sectors like tourism, hospitality and restaurants have lost upwards of 70% of their revenue, forcing them to layoff or furlough staff, reduce salaries, and plead with their landlords to reduce their rent.""Everyone is grappling with this crisis and trying to stay alive,"" he said.Meanwhile, some public affairs PR firms are doing better than ever as state legislatures pass rules and regulations to slow the spread of the virus, he said.Dealmaking could pick up as small firms struggle to surviveBefore the coronavirus pandemic struck, PR was consolidating at a faster rate than in past years, according to Phillip Palazzo, founder of Palazzo Investment Bankers. This trend was driven by private equity, reflated capital markets, lowered interest rates and an expanding economy.



There were 18 completed acquisitions of PR firms in the first few months of 2020, more than double the amount in the year-ago period, said Michael Lasky, an attorney at Davis & Gilbert.Dealmaking has paused as buyers and sellers wait for the economy to stabilize.However, as small, independent firms struggle to survive the economic downturn, other PR experts predict an uptick in consolidation across the industry.An independent PR agency CEO who asked to be anonymous said at least a dozen PR firms have reached out in recent weeks to gauge the CEO's interest in buying them. Instead of presenting a ""poker face,"" the prospective sellers were open about their overhead and payroll.""They know they can't waste time,"" the CEO said.



While experiential firms struggle, digitally focused agencies will benefitThe pandemic has hit experiential PR firms hard, but firms that specialize in digital PR will benefit as companies lean on online channels to manage their communications and reputation.""There are firms focused on experiential that are experiencing significant pain,"" Palazzo said. ""Meanwhile, if you're digital only, it's almost business as usual, with very little change in client spend.""The pandemic will speed business leaders' use of social as a way to speak with a clear, consistent message to customers, stakeholders, and employees, said Roy Tristan, COO of digital at Edelman.The crisis could cement the importance of internal communicationsInternal comms was already gaining importance in response to the rise of employee activism and social media as a place where workers can voice their beliefs and objections. But lately, companies have doubled down on efforts to keep their employees informed about business strategy, what they're doing to ensure their health and safety, and how their operations are affected.""'Our people are our most valuable asset' has become a kind of nice leadership cliché,"" said Steve Astle, senior adviser and west coast lead for employee engagement firm Gagen MacDonald. ""This week, employees at Instacart, Amazon and elsewhere showed the world that there's nothing nice about it – it's just an indisputable fact.""



Astle said internal comms used to focus on sending out open enrollment packets and telling employees about changes in company travel policy, and sees it playing a bigger and more strategic role.""Now and for the foreseeable future, people responsible for employee communications need business acumen and strategic thinking skills – muscles many of them are going to have to develop in a hurry,"" he said.Insiders predict the industry will rebound by Q4Analyst Michael Nathanson predicted the ad industry would shrink by 10.6%, or almost $26 billion this year. But consultants that serve the PR industry think PR will be less scathed.Stevens said after a short-term hit, PR would rebound as clients seek out counsel and comms support even as they dial down their advertising.Edelman CEO Richard Edelman, whose earnings serve as a bellwether for the industry, said business was coming back in China, where his agency just won four clients in late March.



""Communications is now more important than advertising,"" Edelman said. ""People want facts and credible spokespeople."""

   April McGhee and her teenage daughter started feeling sick last month. They had coughs, sore throats and fevers. Her daughter's condition became so bad that they went to the emergency room.
   ""She had it worse than I did,"" McGhee said. ""Her cough lasted longer. It was really a concern. ... It was like a dry, nonproductive, hacking cough.""
   McGhee, who lives in Sacramento, wanted both of them to get tested for the coronavirus. But the hospital told her they weren't sick enough to qualify for testing under California's rules. So, they went home and into isolation.
   
   

   A single mom, McGhee makes ends meet by delivering groceries for Instacart and meals for Postmates. She contacted Instacart to apply for sick pay under a policy the company recently put in place because of the pandemic.
   ""They basically laughed me off,"" McGhee said. ""They said, 'Unless you have the health department or [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] making you stay home on quarantine, or a note from the doctor saying that you've been diagnosed with COVID-19, you're out of luck.'""
   Gig companies like Instacart, Uber and Lyft connect people who need tasks done with workers willing to do them. But the companies consider these workers independent contractors, not employees. The firms generally do not provide paid sick leave or other employee benefits.
      
   

   Now, however, that's changing. The nature of the work that Instacart shoppers, Uber and Lyft drivers and other gig workers do puts them in close contact with strangers. They are, in essence, on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, and some of them are getting sick.
   McGhee joined other Instacart workers who walked off the job Monday to demand better safety measures. She says the company's policy not only puts her at risk, it encourages people who are sick to keep working and, potentially, spread the disease.
   She said the company should keep its workers healthy ""as a buffer zone instead of as a Typhoid Mary.""
   Instacart has since announced it plans to distribute supplies, including masks, hand sanitizer and thermometers, to workers beginning this week.
   Workers for other gig companies are also running into hurdles getting the help they've been promised.
   
   

   After Uber and Lyft driver Khadim Diop fell ill with a fever and sore throat, he got a letter from New York City's health department saying he must stay home for 14 days.
   He showed the letter to both companies to receive sick pay. He hoped it would cover the loss of the roughly $1,000 to $1,500 he says he typically makes per week. He got $250 from Lyft.
   Uber initially rejected his claim, saying he did not qualify for the company's financial assistance program. Uber said it has paid more than 1,400 claims to U.S. drivers in less than three weeks.
   But after NPR contacted Uber, the company reversed its decision regarding Diop. It said his claim should not have been rejected. He has now received about $1,700 from Uber to cover the two weeks of work he's missed.
   That's money he sorely needs.
   ""To be honest, right now, I'm very broke,"" Diop said.
   Uber does not require drivers to get tested for the coronavirus to get paid leave. They can show a doctor's note telling them to isolate themselves to prevent the virus from spreading.
   But Uber's policy does not cover drivers who choose not to work because they're afraid of getting sick.
   ""I have bad lungs already. I'm borderline diabetic. I have high blood pressure,"" said Steve Gregg, an Uber driver in the Bay Area who stopped driving about three weeks ago. ""Getting in that car felt like Russian roulette.""
   Gregg got a note from his doctor explaining his preexisting conditions, but Uber denied his claim. 
   Gregg is now looking elsewhere for help. He's applied for unemployment benefits, which are now available to gig workers under a law Congress passed last month. There are concerns, however, that states cannot process those claims quickly. U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., has called on on the U.S. Labor Department to issue detailed guidance as quickly as possible.
   Editor's note: Lyft and Uber are among NPR's sponsors."

Some staff members also had tested positive, and officials were awaiting results from other patients and workers at the 90-plus-bed facility, public health officials said Sunday. The facility was closed to new admissions, sick patients were being isolated, and staff were not being permitted to work elsewhere. “This is a very serious situation and shows why we must all take serious steps to change our behavior, because these steps are intended to protect our most vulnerable,"" Riverside County Supervisor Karen Spiegel said in a statement. The county also said another person had died of the coronavirus and 134 had tested positive, bringing the county's death toll to 19 and its total number of cases to 799. Nursing homes and assisted-living centers across California continued to see significant increases in coronavirus cases, alarming officials who are trying to slow the spread. The older populations of these facilities almost always have underlying health problems, making them particularly vulnerable to the virus. They often live in close quarters. Administrators have responded by banning visitors, confining patients to their rooms and scrambling to create sterile wings to treat residents who contract the disease. Still, there have been outbreaks at facilities from Redondo Beach to Burlingame. Twenty-seven people at a skilled nursing facility in the East Bay city of Orinda have tested positive for the coronavirus."

					A Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo has tested positive for COVID-19 but is expected to recover, according to an announcement released on Sunday by the Wildlife Conservation Society at the New York zoo. 
""Nadia, a 4-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, has tested positive for COVID-19. She, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers, and three African lions had developed a dry cough and all are expected to recover,"" the statement read. ""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus."" 
The tiger's positive coronavirus test was confirmed by USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratory. 
Further, the statement also described the animal's symptoms, citing that though they have experienced some appetite loss, ""the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers.""

The USNS Comfort, docked in New York City harbor, had originally been designated as a space for non-coronavirus patients to alleviate the pressure from New York hospitals.

New York City's hospitals have been overwhelmed with coronavirus cases and are struggling to respond to patients streaming in. A shortage of personal protective equipment has also placed medical workers at risk of contracting the virus.

The US coronavirus death toll is now more than triple that of the 9/11 attacks, with almost half of the known pandemic-related deaths in New York.

There are at least 331,151 cases of coronavirus in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University's latest tally of cases. At least 9,441 people have died in the nation from the virus.

Genetic testing and in-vitro fertilization testing company Yikon Genomics — which does business under the name Yikon Global — and its CEO Brandon Richard Hensinger, were listed as defendants, according to the suit.

“In this public health emergency, consumers require and under California law are entitled to accurate, reliable, and truthful information about COVID-19, including its testing,” the suit states. “The health, and even the lives, of California consumers depend on it.”

The city is seeking a court order that directs the company to stop marketing and selling the test kits plus $2,500 in fines for each alleged violation.

To date, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved any coronavirus tests for at-home testing. The agency has warned consumers against at-home testing, the suit states.

A Yikon Global representative could not be immediately reached for comment.

Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and other North Carolina bankers scramble with Paycheck Protection Program,2020-04-05 23:32:37+00:00,http://feeds.bizjournals.com/~r/industry_2/~3/hdUJDrqi5Ts/nc-bankers-scramble-on-the-first-day-of-federal.html,[],0,0,"['Carolina', 'bankers', 'North', 'NYSE', 'Paycheck', 'Protection', 'America', 'Program', 'Bank', 'North Carolina', 'BAC', 'loans', 'small businesses', 'Business', 'Friday', 'applications', 'processes', 'Small', 'Gwaltney', 'Pinnacle', 'interest', 'Thursday', 'Lamb', 'interest rate', 'CEO', 'CNBC', 'tweet', 'chief operating officer', 'red tape', 'PPP', 'baseball', 'Roy Cooper', 'pie', 'financial adviser', 'bank', 'credit unions', 'Charlotte', 'Steven Mnuchin', 'Wells Fargo', 'scrambling', 'Coronavirus', 'coronavirus', 'lightning', 'Small Business Administration', 'NASDAQ', '#PPP', '#PakistanPeoplesParty', '#Bank', '#CEO', '#ChiefExecutiveOfficer', '#NYSE', '#NewYorkStockExchange', '#NorthCarolina', '#BAC', '#BloodAlcoholContent', '#Paycheck', '#CharlotteNorthCarolina', '#InterestRate', '#Scrambling', '#SmallBusinessAdministration', '#Coronavirus', '#CreditUnion', '#FinancialAdviser', '#NASDAQ', '#NASDAQ', '#ChiefOperatingOfficer', '#RedTape', '#Lightning', '#Pie', '#RoyCooper', '#Twitter', '#StevenMnuchin', '#CNBC', '#CNBC', '#WellsFargo', '#Baseball']","The federal government's Paycheck Protection Program launched Friday with local bankers scrambling to take applications as quickly as possible.


The program authorizes up to $349 billion in loans through the Small Business Administration as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act — or CARES Act — signed into law a week ago. It's designed to give small businesses quick funding to mostly cover payroll, but also rent and utilities, for eight weeks after a loan is made. The loan will be forgiven if businesses maintain employee pay, according to a PPP fact sheet. Loan payments will be deferred for six months. 


            
            
        But the SBA and U.S. Treasury didn't release final guidelines until Thursday evening – hours before the program was scheduled to go live. 


NewDominion Bank CEO Blaine Jackson was one of many bankers who stayed up late studying the guidelines as soon as they were released. Phone calls and emails started early Friday morning. Most his of schedule on Friday was booked with conference calls. 


Charlotte-based NewDominion is a subsidiary of Ohio-based Park National Corp. Jackson said the bank won't start processing the PPP loans until Monday at the earliest. It is, however, accepting applications in advance. 


That's the case for many banks across North Carolina, said Peter Gwaltney, CEO of the N.C. Bankers Association. The last-minute guidelines leave much unanswered as banks rush to set up internal processes. Some banks are still waiting on SBA credentials. That has to happen before lenders have access to the online program to process applications, he said.


""Bankers spent all night reading, working on their systems, preparing their people for the unprecedented demand for this,"" Gwaltney said.


The federal government designed the program to roll out first through the SBA's preferred lenders, Gwaltney said. There are approximately 1,700 preferred lenders, compared to roughly 5,100 total in the U.S., he noted. More banks, credit unions and some financial-technology companies will follow suit next week. Many banks are accepting loan applications even if they can't process them yet.


Stan Lamb, financial adviser at Pinnacle Financial Partners Inc. (NASDAQ: PNFP), said he hasn't seen anything like this in his 20-plus years in the business.


Setting up for the PPP process has been a top-down approach at Pinnacle. The director of Pinnacle's SBA group is working directly with the chief operating officer, Lamb said. Pinnacle is prioritizing coronavirus-related lending. Typical SBA real-estate loans take 30 to 45 days, he said, but officials have alleviated some of the red tape to get the PPP loans out as quickly as possible.


""You're trying to roll out a program at lightning speed,"" Lamb said. ""Everybody wants to get their piece of the pie ... of what's available for their business to help them through this because everybody's struggling. Everybody's hurting right now, and they want to get in as soon as it's available.""


Pinnacle was ready to accept applications on Friday morning. Spokesperson Joe Bass said the bank has seen a steady stream of applications coming in since Thursday night. 


The SBA approved Gov. Roy Cooper's disaster declaration request earlier this month, allowing North Carolina's small businesses to apply for low-interest economic injury disaster loans. Lamb believes the SBA created the PPP because its disaster loans are not necessarily built for nationwide crises. 


Jim Engel, CEO of Aquesta Financial Holdings Inc., based in Cornelius north of Charlotte, said the bank's loan volume is ""massive"" compared to a normal time. Aquesta had about 120 PPP loans in progress as of Friday afternoon. 


Engel enlisted some branch employees to help input data and trained non-lenders to answer questions about the SBA's application process. At first he was seeing loan demand mostly from restaurants and hotels. That has since expanded into multiple retail sectors, including medical offices, he said.


On Thursday, Engel expressed his concern about the PPP's chosen 0.5 percent interest rate. He was hoping to break even on borrowing costs – saying it was ""not going to be a big moneymaker."" The federal government has since hiked the interest rate to 1 percent. That decision came after many banks raised questions on the previous rate. 


Jackson declined to share details on NewDominion clients' interest thus far, but he expects ""a significant number"" to apply for PPP loans. 


For him, important questions remain: How will the loan be forgiven? How does the bank ensure the money is used for eligible purposes? Does the six-month deferral apply to principal and interest?


Questions may not be answered for days or weeks, however. It all depends on how quickly the federal government moves on clarifications and processing the first applications. The SBA was processing more than $1.8 billion in loans as of 2 p.m. Friday, mostly from community banks, according to a tweet from Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin. Some of the large banks had not yet submitted numbers, he wrote. 


Charlotte's Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) was the first big bank to launch its PPP loan portal on Friday morning. The system prioritizes BofA's 1 million borrowing customers, CEO Brian Moynihan said in a CNBC interview. He urged small businesses to go to their primary banks to keep the process running smoothly.


Wells Fargo  Co. (NYSE: WFC) is still working to launch its PPP portal. On Friday, the bank said it is ""working as quickly as possible"" and is encouraging customers to keep checking its website.


Gwaltney refers to the recent scramble as ""inside baseball.""


""Opening day is here. It's April 3 and this is the day America's small businesses were told they could go to their bank and get one of these loans. So, it's not ideal circumstances, but banks are having to exercise some faith,"" he said. ""We're just asking for patience."""

The Biggest Uncertainty
 
I see that Tony Nitti has addressed PPP this morning with Paycheck Protection Plan Loans: Three Things The SBA And Banks Need To Agree On Now. Good stuff there. Check it out. I am going to focus on one of the three and also take a step back and look at a larger picture.
 
The language in the legislation that is now driving accountants crazy is this exclusion from defined “payroll costs”:
 
 
 (bb) taxes imposed or withheld under chapters 21, 22, or 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 during the covered period;
 
Chapter 24 is the biggest concern - Collection of Income Tax At Source on Wages.
 
A really on-the-ball CPA Daniel Baratz of the Zenith Group wrote me on March 29 (two days after the act passed)
 
“Based on my read of this, the Act excludes taxes assessed or withheld under Chapters 21, 22 and 24 of the Code. From what I can tell, this is FICA, Railroad and Withholding at the source. 
 
To me, this seems to indicate that the amount of “payroll costs” eligible to be the basis for calculating the loan amount is your gross payroll MINUS federal income tax withholding as well as both employee and employer shares of social security and Medicare. Maybe I am missing something but I am having a hard time not reading it this way and also a really hard time believing that this was congress’ intent. 
 
If I am reading it right, this would mean, in theory at least that if an employee has chosen to have 100% of their pay withheld for FIT, the employer could borrow nothing to keep paying that employee during this period. Similarly, their ability to have loan amounts forgiven would actually be partly determined by each employee’s W-4. I really hope I am reading this wrong or the regulatory interpretation can get around this – what do you think?”
 
Here is my lame response.
 
“That is interesting. I don't read it that way. I'll look again. It will be clear pretty quickly when people start applying.”
 
That was last Sunday. It was around Wednesday or Thursday, that most of the rest of the world was catching up with Daniel Baratz. The CPA I consult for who drops F-bombs like a B-17 drops 500-pounders was on me about it on Thursday.
 
Why Accountants Think It Cannot Be So
 
I just don’t think of withholding as a tax that the employer is paying. I think of it as money that no longer belongs to the employer and is held in trust to be paid over rather quickly. And for many if not most employers, it goes into the hands of a payroll company at the same time the net is paid. Given the nasty stuff that happens when you fail to pay withholding it is a reasonable view.
 
But remember Reilly’s First Law of Tax Planning: It is what it is. Deal with it. In this case what it is remains unclear.
 
More From Daniel Baratz
 
At any rate, yesterday I call Mr. Baratz to eat a little crow, congratulate him for being ahead of the curve and ask for any further comments. He was very gracious. Here is some of what he wrote back to me:
 
“The federal government has an existing definition for “payroll costs”. It is reported by every employer in America on quarterly payroll tax returns. Despite that, 
 
 
 Section 1102 of the CARES act creates its own original and unique definition of “payroll costs” that does not exist anywhere else in the known universe and actually has no bearing on the actual amount of dollars (cost) employers must expend to pay their payroll!  
 
  
 
The result in a practical sense is that based on the current definition, even if an employer maintains 100% of their workforce and pays them 100% of their existing wages, they will likely have only a portion of their loan forgiven even though they have complied with the stated intention of the program. What is even crazier is that the amount of the forgiveness will actually be driven by each individual employee’s withholding elections. So, an employer that has several employees who request more tax to be withheld from their pay because maybe they like to get a big refund is penalized and will have less of their loan forgiven than someone whose employees choose to have less withheld. There is no economic basis for this approach. I do not know for sure what Congress’ intent was with excluding certain employee-paid taxes from the definition of Payroll Costs but I surely hope this was not it.”
 
I still think you should probably still apply for the loan, but please put it in a separate account and wait for some clarity before you count on not having to pay it back.
 
Take A Step Back
 
Remember that the Paycheck Protection Plan is not the only tool that Congress has given us to help deal with the crisis. 
 
There is the Employee Retention Credit Tony Nitti explained it further here.
 
There is the Economic Injury Disaster Loan.
 
There is Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.
 
That is not all, but it’s a lot.
 
And then there are tools that were already in the tool-box, but kind of buried pretty deep. One of those is Code Section 139 - Disaster Relief Payments. John E. McGrady discusses that here.
 
Some Probably Bad Ideas You Should Consider Anyway
 
It has occurred to me that an alternative or supplement to PPP might be laying some people off and then helping them out with some deductible disaster relief payments. Maybe you just use PPP money for people that can keep doing something during the crisis. Of course that sort of course assumes you have some resources. 
 
 On the other hand, that $600 per week supplement to unemployment might be a better deal than you paying them money that you might have to pay back even if you don’t have something extra to throw in.
 
I would not recommend taking up to $100,000 out of retirement accounts that you can put back during the next three years, but perhaps when combined with the net operating loss carryback that might be what lets you pull through.
 
Start With A Blank Slate
 
Now, I just gave you two quite likely bad ideas, but there might be the germ of a good idea buried in there. This reminds me a little bit of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 which made my career, because I read a bit more than the average accountant in my firm who lived by oral tradition and following last year. All of a sudden everything they knew was wrong.
 
As you look at these programs and how they interact and what your particular situation is, try to clear your mind of preconceived notions. Don’t fixate on any one tool. PPP might be a great hammer, but maybe your problem is not a nail."

President Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine as a potential life-saver, although there is no widespread scientific evidence to date showing it helps battle COVID-19.

But Gov. Andrew Cuomo last month said healthcare providers in the state would be using the drug in combination with the antibiotic Zithromax, or azithromycin, for some last-ditch cases, based on potentially promising research.

“Time is of the essence,’’ said Albany University Public Health Dean David Holtgrave, who is on the state’s research team, in a statement.

A state Health Department official said the DOH has shipped doses of hydroxychloroquine to 56 hospitals across New York, distributing enough “to treat 4,000 patients to date.”

Patients have received doses as part of four- or 10-day regimens, officials said.

The University of Albany’s School of Public Health is observing the drug’s impact on the patients, and its preliminary study could come back in weeks instead of the usual months, officials said.

There are also clinical trials being conducted to see whether the drug can help block transmission.

NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a random trial with a $9.5 million grant from the Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation.

“Currently, there is no proven way to prevent COVID-19 after being exposed,” said Anna Bershteyn, an assistant professor with the Department of Population Health at NYU Langone and the study’s co-principal investigator.

“If hydroxychloroquine provides protection, then it could be an essential tool for fighting this pandemic. If it doesn’t, then people should avoid unnecessary risks from taking the drug.”

The RX has long been used to treat malaria, rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.

Its potential side effects include everything from fatal heart arrhythmia to vision loss, ear-ringing, vomiting, mood changes, skin rashes and hair loss.

Health officials are treading cautiously, saying they don’t anticipate hydroxychloroquine will be a “miracle drug” against the coronavirus — but the studies are worth the gamble.

In terms of the NYU clinical trial regarding prevention, researchers are enrolling 2,000 adult volunteers at six sites.

They are recruiting people who lack any COVID-19 symptoms but have been in close contact with others who have a confirmed or pending diagnosis.

On a random basis, the trial participants will receive either hydroxychloroquine or a placebo pill — vitamin C — every day for two weeks.

Each day during the 14-day period and then again on Day 28, the participants will swab their nasal passages and send the samples to researchers to detect potential COVID-19 infection.

“If everything goes as planned, the eight-week trial could provide answers by summer on whether a preventive dose of the drug is safe and effective,’’ NYU Langone said in a release.


“If so, the strategy could give health officials a much needed boost in slowing person-to-person transmission.”

The federal Food and Drug Administration granted emergency-use authorization to use hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients amid the pandemic.

There has been anecdotal evidence — including from China — that the drug help patients clear the virus sooner.

But Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, asked recently whether the drug was considered a treatment for the novel coronavirus, said, “The answer is no … The evidence that you’re talking about … is anecdotal evidence.”

Meanwhile, Northwell Health facilities — including Lenox Hill, Long Island Jewish and Staten Island University hospitals — and Maimonides Medical Center are giving moderately to seriously ill coronavirus patients certain antiviral drugs such as Sarilumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, and Remdesivir, a drug that incorporates itself into the genome.

Northwell has recruited 143 patients for a Sarilumab trial.

Mount Sinai’s-Icahn School of Medicine also is one of 34 institutions nationwide participating in the National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. The program seeks blood-plasma donations from recovered coronavirus patients that contain antibodies that can be used to fight the virus in seriously ill patients."

Neither of the two workers had been at the Evergreen Park store for at least a week, Walmart said in a statement on Sunday. It's unclear how long either of the employees had the virus. It's also unclear whether COVID-19 was contracted on the job.

The victims were Wando Evans, 51, and Phillip Thomas, 48, Patch.com reported. Both had underlying health conditions, medical examiners told the online publication. The CDC says symptoms typically occur between two days and two weeks after exposure.

""We are heartbroken to learn of the passing of two associates at our Evergreen Park store, and we are mourning along with their families,"" Walmart said in a statement to USA TODAY.

The store in question passed a third-party safety and environmental compliance test as well as a health department inspection within the past week, according to the company.

The discount retailer also said it was changing the way it approaches sanitation following the deaths, including hiring a third-party company to clean and sanitize high-touch surfaces at the store.

Walmart recently began limiting the number of shoppers allowed in its stores in a push to promote social distancing.

Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay announced Sunday on Twitter that he acquired over 10,000 N95 masks and plans on distributing them to some of the medical workers who need them most amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Irsay said he will donate the masks to the Indiana State Department of Health so they can eventually get to hospitals.
Doctors and nurses have relied on N95 masks while interacting with patients who have tested positive for the virus.

Health-care workers and first responders across the country have been in short supply for masks as they continued to fight the coronavirus pandemic. New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft sent the team plane to China to pick up 1.2 million N95 masks just a few days ago, and he planned to get them distributed in the Massachusetts and New York areas.

Tony Spell of Life Tabernacle Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. ""We'd rather obey God than man.""

About 1,220 people attended, some bused in and others driving more than 100 miles to attend, Spell told CNN. Spell has previously told CNN he believes the pandemic is ""politically motivated.""

The Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. of Friendship Baptist Church in Baltimore, Maryland, said he had a steady stream of people walking through the church, processional style, careful not to have more than eight or nine.

Religious organizations should be on the list of essential organizations, he told CNN. In Jupiter, Florida, some 20 people attended service at Ascend Church, CNN affiliate WPEC reported. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has exempted worship services from the state's current coronavirus orders. Parishioners attend a Palm Sunday worship service at City On A Hill Church in Houston, Texas. The service was held in the church's parking lot and the church practiced social distancing during the service. Some churches, like Amplified Church in San Antonio , Texas, and Calvary's Hill Church in Bluefield, Virginia, held drive-in services with loudspeakers. ""Our pastor at Amplified Church, like many other pastors are trying to do their best to keep the people connected and safe; still abiding by the social distancing regulations,"" a church spokesperson told CNN via Facebook. ""It has been a challenge, but we are thankful even in the midst of this pandemic that we can spread the gospel,"" the message said. Police are arresting and fining people for violating social distancing orders Despite several clusters of Covid-19 sicknesses traced to congregations -- at least 70 cases were traced to a single church in Sacramento, California -- other states are also allowing services to continue. ""Churches by and large do the right thing, they want to protect their parishioners,"" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson told reporters Sunday. ""There are a few that have a very small attendance and they socially distance. We don't recommend that, but if it's within the guidelines, then that's understandable."" Hutchinson did mention officials ""had trouble with a church putting parishioners at risk."" After the health department called them, ""they took the right steps and are not meeting"" with a large congregation, Hutchinson said. Some local leaders have been speaking out against exempting church services from a ban on gatherings and are asking churches to hold them online. 'Not what we need right now' ""I know it's a very difficult thing, as a Catholic, Easter Sunday for me next week, Palm Sunday today,"" said Boston Mayor Marty Walsh. ""But that is not what we need right now. We need prayers right now, that's what we need."" Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez thanked religious leaders who were holding services online in lieu of regular mass on Palm Sunday, he said in a video briefing on YouTube. Quarantine life is starting to feel like a real Lent ""That's the safest way to keep us all connected,"" Gimenez said. ""Let's help us all stay safer at home during these religious holy days."" The Archdiocese of Miami suspended all Masses and events on March 16 and encouraged parishes to use livestreaming when possible, Archbishop Thomas Wenski said this week on CNN's New Day. The number of Covid-19 cases rose to at least 331,151 nationwide Sunday, and at least 9,441 people have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University"

It’s arguably the first “infodemic,” as news spreads literally virally across social media and media outlets. In a time of uncertainty, we hunger for information. Yet even though internet access means much news is at our fingertips, it’s not always easy to evaluate the quality of what we’re reading—and what it actually means about the state of science.
If you’re being bombarded with facts about Covid-19 and aren’t sure whether to trust them, think like we do here at Quartz. Questioning new information with a measured sense of skepticism and a little digging can help you avoid taking in sensationalized information. The following is good advice not just during this pandemic, but any time you pick up the health and science section of a given publication.
Remember the warp-speed timeline
Covid-19 is caused by a virus, SARS-CoV-2, that no one knew about until a few months ago. Scientists have not had time to study it in-depth. Much of what they’re learning is based on what we’re observing from an epidemiological standpoint and what we know about other viruses, like the flu and SARS.
The quality of science is good—it just isn’t as robust as other fields are yet. The pandemic has sparked an unprecedented amount of international research collaboration. Scientists are working around the clock to figure out new ways to treat the virus and develop vaccines against it. Journals are publishing pre-prints of papers as soon as they can to make sure that everyone has access to the most up-to-date information, rather than waiting for a period of review and to publish within a particular issue.
Remember that new information may be true, but hasn’t had time to be validated by other studies just yet. “This kind of healthy skepticism does not mean you’re dismissing everything as false—it simply means remembering the things you hear could be false, but they could also be true…or they could be something in between,” Emma Frans, an epidemiology and psychiatry researcher at Oxford University in the UK and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, told TED.
Weigh the scientific evidence
When a headline claims a new study uncovered a truth about Covid-19, look for a link to the study in the article—or at least a scientific journal named so you can find it on your own. You don’t have to read the whole paper (if you can access it) to get a sense of what it’s about, although it’s great if you can.
First, make sure the actual scientific article seems to reflect what the news is saying. Is it even, in fact, about Covid-19? Or is it about another biological process that may have implications for the spread or severity of the disease?
If it is about Covid-19, see what kind of research it is. Many of the papers coming out about Covid-19 are observational studies, in which researchers report what happened to a group of people in a certain setting. These studies can be great—particularly if they have a sample size of more than 1,000 people. They can point researchers to correlations, or patterns of outcomes in certain circumstances. (You should be skeptical of papers that only write up one person, called a case study, or a handful of people. These are too small to make meaningful assumptions about the general public.)
Observational studies may be biased in the kinds of people they study (for example, only those who got sick enough to go to the hospital). They also can’t tell scientists why something is happening on a biological level, or the causation. They’re reporting what happened to a group of people in a way that may be able to inform what may happen to others in similar circumstances.
Ideally, any observational study would have some sort of lab study that presents more research that could lead to a reason why the observed outcome happened (as with this study and accompanying article). Scientists haven’t had time to do many lab studies on SARS-CoV-2 just yet, so unfortunately this information isn’t widely available.
For any research claiming that a treatment or vaccine works, remember that the highest standard of evidence is a randomized controlled trial. In these experiments, some participants receive a placebo intervention, some get the tested intervention, and neither clinicians nor participants know what they received. Researchers may not have time to do these kinds of studies—which, again, doesn’t mean that anything less is bad. It’s just a reminder that the science isn’t certain just yet.
It’s also common for scientists to publish reviews or meta-analyses, which are papers that gather and weigh the evidence of specific papers. Given that Covid-19 is so new, many researchers are putting forth ideas that could be good places to look in the future. These papers are helpful, but they can’t be taken as the absolute truth. Unfortunately, one such paper hypothesizing that ibuprofen could worsen cases of Covid-19 led to a panic about the pain reliever, despite the fact that there’s only anecdotal evidence. It could be true—but again, scientists don’t know yet.
See where the information is coming from…
Did you read your information on a news website? Or did it come from a social media post? If the latter, were you asked to share it on? If so, tell us—but also increase your skepticism.
If you’re having trouble figuring out if your source is a trusted one, remember that no trusted news outlets will be touting remedies or cures—those don’t exist for this virus (or most conditions, frankly).
Quality science writing outlines all of the information described above about a study, and states which research institutions the scientists came from. Ideally, there’s also an outside source weighing in on the new information being presented. And it should always note the study’s limitations, or what it can’t tell researchers.
…And who else supports it
If you’re reading a news story that no other outlet else is reporting on, and the information doesn’t seem like anything else you’ve read—chances are you should be extra skeptical.
And above all, the top sources you should trust for research about Covid-19 are the national and international public health groups. As Quartz previously reported, the World Health Organization, the US Centers for Disease Control, the National Health Service in the UK, or the Public Health Agency of Canada are your best bets."

Scott Melter of Wyoming just retired last year. The 60-year-old, who had COPD, had also beat lung cancer last year. But on Wednesday, COVID-19 took his life.

Krystal Pearl’s Melter daughter, says he leaves behind a large family, and an even larger legacy. 

“He always wanted everybody to feel so loved,” Pearl said. “He was the best Papa in the entire world to his grandchildren. He would always take them on special ‘Papa dates.’ He would show up in a suit with flowers.”

She also spoke of his generosity.

“Everything that he owned, he wanted to share with everybody, he wanted people to experience,” Pearl said. “He loved vacationing, he loved bringing people on vacations so they could experience things.”

And that’s exactly what he did early last month. The family traveled to Mexico as word of COVID-19 started to spread.

“We had even talked about it on vacation, you know. He had said, ‘Yeah, you know, it’s not going to be good if somebody like me gets it,'” Pearl said.

So after the trip, Melter and his beloved wife of 35 years left their Ridgeland, South Carolina winter home to come back to Minnesota.

“I had said, you know, ‘I want you here so that we can just keep you home and away from everything and we can help you out,'” Pearl said.

It was on the drive to what they thought was safety that they realized Melter was in danger.

“He just had said he was just kind of tired, and he wasn’t feeling real well. He actually was like, ‘I’m not overly concerned, I don’t think it’s COVID because, like, the symptoms that I’m having don’t really line up with what they’re saying,’ but then obviously it progressed pretty quickly after that,” Pearl said.

Melter was admitted to M Health Fairview in Wyoming on March 25. That would be the last day he would ever see his wife. He tested positive for COVID-19 and was put in isolation at Bethesda Hospital in St. Paul.  

“We were able to have one person be with him when we knew that he wasn’t going to get better, so that was my brother,” Pearl said. “We decided as a family that he should go because I was just on the trip with him.  I’m so grateful that my brother, that they allowed him to be there and to FaceTime us so we could say our goodbyes. It was special.”

Now, Pearl hopes that anyone who hears her father’s story does not feel fear, but instead, peace.

“There is a lot of good happening, and there’s a lot of light being spread, and a lot of love being spread, and that’s what my dad would want,” Pearl said. “He would want people to know God’s got this, you know, we’re going to be OK.”

Melter’s wife, Treva, is now alone in quarantine, but says she feels lots of love through FaceTime. The family has decided to wait and hold a celebration of life for Melter sometime in the future."

P!nk on 3-Year-Old Son's Coronavirus Symptoms: 'I've Never Prayed More in My Life'



4/5/2020

by


Ashley Iasimone
 









In the midst of quarantine parenting, things got scary for P!nk, who tested positive for COVID-19 alongside her 3-year-old son, Jameson.

The singer, who revealed their diagnosis earlier this week, had a long discussion about her family's experience with the coronavirus with friend and author Jen Pastiloff on Instagram on Sunday (April 5). The live chat was part of a ""Chat and Feed"" series to raise money to feed people in need.

""I haven't dressed up in three weeks. I really needed it. Thank you for the opportunity,"" P!nk said as she began to talk about this ""crazy time.""


""We have been really, really sick,"" she noted. ""My 3-year-old, Jameson, has had the worst of it. I've had many nights where I've cried and I've never prayed more in my life.""

""At one point I heard myself saying, 'I thought they promised us our kids would be OK.' And it's not guaranteed. There's no one that is safe from this,"" said P!nk, who later described her 3-year-old as ""perfectly fine"" before contracting COVID-19. Although she and Jameson fell ill, her husband Carey and daughter Willow did not.

""Jameson's been really, really sick,"" she explained. ""I've kept a journal of his symptoms for the past three weeks, and mine as well. He still, three weeks later, has a 100 temperature ... It's been a roller coaster. It's been a different roller coaster for both of us.""

Though he is doing better, Jameson's symptoms have included ""a fever for three weeks and diarrhea and then constipation and then throwing up and pale and listless and lethargic and all the things that scare the bejeezus out of you as a mama.""

""He says the worst part was the prune juice,"" the pop star joked.

She went on to detail how COVID-19 affected her own health, explaining that while she has asthma, she is fit and the virus had her ""on nebulizers for the first time in 30 years"" -- and ""it got really, really scary, I'm not gonna lie.""

""Just when you think you're better, something else happens. It's been three weeks for me, four weeks for him,"" said the singer, who has donated  $1 million to support healthcare workers on the frontlines during the coronavirus pandemic.

On Sunday, Australian police announced they've launched a criminal investigation into the Ruby Princess, citing questions over whether the operators of the ship, Carnival Australia, were transparent about sickened passengers and crew members.

More than 340 passengers have tested positive for the coronavirus and at least three passengers who contracted the virus on the cruise ship have died in recent days, according to the New South Wales Ministry of Health. Sixteen crew members have already tested positive for the virus, according to the New South Wales Police Force, while another 200 are exhibiting symptoms.

Police Commissioner Mick Fuller, speaking at a press conference, said that Australian authorities had made contact with the ship, ""And on each case, they were informed that COVID-19 wasn't an issue on the ship.""

""There seems to be absolute discrepancies between the information provided by Carnival and what I would see as the benchmark for the laws that the Federal Government and the State Government put in place in terms of protecting Australians from cruise ships when coronavirus had started,"" Fuller said. ""The only way I can determine whether our national biosecurity laws or our state laws were broken is through a criminal investigation.""

In a statement, a spokesman for Carnival Australia said the company would ""willingly"" cooperate with the investigation.

""Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them,"" according to the statement.

While Fuller said there were ""many unanswered questions"" about the the Ruby Princess, ""there is clear evidence that corona-19 has been brought off that ship.""

As of Sunday, there were a total of 5,687 cases of coronavirus in Australia. At least 35 have died from the virus there, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University."

One of the most remarkable people we met working on this story was Holocaust survivor Max Eisen. He lives in Toronto but had traveled to Los Angeles for five long days of intensive interviews with the USC Shoah Foundation team, who asked him about his childhood in the former Czechoslovakia, his deportation to the Auschwitz concentration camp with his entire family when he was a teenager, and the horrors he experienced as a slave laborer in the camp.

Eisen's hours and hours of interview footage will be put into a database and processed so that people long into the future will be able to ask him their own questions, and artificial intelligence algorithms will retrieve the appropriate answer from the database, enabling real-time conversations with him to continue -- forever.

Amidst the tragic loss, cruelty, and horror Eisen experienced during the war, there were also acts of kindness, one of which saved his life. In the clip above, we watched as Eisen spoke about the Polish surgeon who he credits with his survival, and he told us about the last words his father told him as they were separated for the last time, which helped push him to take part in the project.

""And so my father gave me a blessing, which is a custom in a Jewish family, Friday night when we come home from synagogue. And he told me if I managed to survive, I must tell the world what happened here,"" Eisen said. ""This was the last thing that my father told me.""

Eisen turned 91 in March. Until a few weeks ago, when the coronavirus stopped all gatherings, he maintained a remarkable travel and speaking schedule, sharing his story widely. He's also written a memoir, called ""By Chance Alone."""

Lance Gooden (R-TX) told Breitbart News Saturday that his legislation would investigate and hold China accountable for spreading the novel coronavirus.

Gooden unveiled the Stop China-Originated Viral Infectious Disease (COVID) Act of 2020, otherwise known as the Stop COVID Act, which would amend the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) to allow the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and allow the DOJ to file claims against the Chinese Community Party in the United States.

Gooden explained to Breitbart News Saturday host Matthew Boyle, “China currently enjoys immunity from U.S. litigation, even if it becomes known that China manufactured this deadly virus. This bill would change that. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of the 1970s … says that U.S. courts cannot hear a case against a foreign nation. So what this bill does is amend that law in the case of a bioweapon being used against our citizens. We all know that this pandemic didn’t just happen, even if it was an accident, even if investigations prove it wasn’t a weapon. The Chinese nonetheless have been lying about how this started. If China had been honest from day one, if they had talked about how serious this was, then the flight bans would have started much sooner and the response could have started much sooner, and the world could have prepared for this. Now, we are suffering and losing American lives.”

“What this bill does is allow the Department of Justice to investigate the origins of this, and we’ll take it a step further and hold someone accountable if someone is responsible. I suspect China is, because the roads all seem to lead that way,” he added.

“American lives are ending today because of Chinese inaction and dishonesty. I think that is unforgivable,” he said.

“If we can put the Department of Justice in charge of an investigation … we can take steps to actually make [China] pay.” Gooden concluded.

""The significance of Lucky being 60 years old is very big,"" said Candace Gutierrez, one of the zoo's animal care specialists, during Lucky's livestreamed birthday celebration.

""It's a tribute to the care that they get with our staff,"" Gutierrez said. ""Their wild counterparts do not live as long because again their teeth wear down, their eyesight changes, even their hearing and their skin is sensitive.""

Fans of Lucky were able to watch her and her two elephant friends, Nichole and Karen, snack on her birthday treats on the livestream. Lucky has been at the San Antonio Zoo since 1962. She's known by her keepers as being one of the sweetest and most laid-back elephants at the zoo. The big girl is a fan of treats and playing fetch. Most Asian elephants in the wild live for an average of 48 years and elephants at the zoo tend to live longer because they receive special food, daily foot work and body checks, Gutierrez said. It costs the zoo $3,500 a month to feed one Asian elephant, Tim Morrow, the zoo's president said in an email. The zoo, which is hurting financially due to the coronavirus lockdown, used the celebration as an opportunity to do some fundraising. ""Unlike most zoos in the country, San Antonio Zoo depends 100% on ticket sales, guest spending, grants, and donations to operate. With no visitors, the zoo has lost almost the entirety of its income,"" Morrow said, before asking for donations."

Last spring, Ciancio scored 55 goals, collected 62 ground balls, caused 31 turnovers and was a first team All-Central League and All-Main Line selection. She also was the Fords’ MVP and a US Lacrosse Academic All-American. She received the Fords’ Hustle Award as both a freshman and sophomore. An honor roll student every semester of her high school career, she will be playing lacrosse for Temple University.

Q: What were your goals for this spring season?

A: I always set individual and team goals for every season. I set my goals in early February this year, they were to reach 100 goals, to be an Academic All-American again, and to be an All American. My team goals were to make district playoffs because I’ve never seen a playoff game. Another goal that was at the top of my list was to be a good leader, to lead by example and bond as a team. Team chemistry is extremely important if we want to be successful. Closer to the season in March, I added a goal and that was to have a season in general and to actually play.

Q: What aspects of your game did you work on most during the off-season?

A: This year the other captains and I really wanted to be a physically fit and strong team. From November to February we were in the weight room twice a week to try to achieve that goal. Closer to the season we were on the turf a lot more and I decided to focus on my crease roll. Because I play midfield I’m usually at the top of the 8 meter but I wanted to work on skills I don’t normally get the chance to do.

Q: What are your thoughts about the delay of the spring sports season because of the coronavirus situation? How do you see your current role as team captain, given the uncertain status (as of April 6) of the spring season?

A: The season delay obviously isn’t what anyone planned for and definitely not how I wanted to spend my senior season, but things happen and it’s out of my control so I just have to adjust and move forward. The captains have been in touch with the whole team a lot. We post on the havlax Instagram, wall ball videos, workouts, run, etc.  I actually put together a workout for the team and we are going to do it together on Zoom (Videochat) on Monday [April 6]. Just to stay keep spirits high and keep in shape.

Q: What do you think were the keys to your scoring proficiency last spring?

A: I was way more aggressive towards goal than in previous years. I also gained more confidence in that I was finally an upperclassman and going into my junior season I was already committed to Temple.  I am a natural lefty but my “dominant” hand for lacrosse is my right. Having a significant amount of control in both hands makes me ambidextrous in lacrosse, allowing me to switch and have a hard accurate shot with both hands which is a huge advantage. All three things combined is why I went from 15 goals my sophomore year to 55 goals my junior year.

Q: Tell us a little about your start in lacrosse. What originally attracted you to lacrosse? Who have been your most important lacrosse mentors, and what was the most important thing each of them taught you?

A: I started lacrosse in 4th grade, my mom played field hockey and lacrosse in high school so she just signed me up because she liked it. I was terrible and had no idea what I was doing. It was only a rec league but some of the girls had been playing for a year or two already. My dad had no idea how to play lacrosse, so when I got better and more serious about playing he did everything he could to learn about it and help me get better. He watched instructional videos, he learned the rules, we watched college highlights and he took me to a lot of college games. He would always push me to be better and learn something new.

Q: Do you participate in any other extracurricular activities at Haverford High other than lacrosse?

A: The only other sport I play is field hockey, but I’m in a lot of clubs. I’m in National Honor Society, NBHS, NTHS, SNHS, Science Academy, and Best Buddies.

Q: What do you think you might want to major in at Temple? Is there a career field that particularly interests you at the present time?

A: I am planning on majoring in health professions at Temple, and possibly minoring in nutrition or public health. I know I want to do something in the medical field and I want eventually to go to med school.  I have an interest in dermatology, but I’m open to anything and my interests could change in years to come.

Favorite book: The Smartest Kids in the World and How They Got That Way by Amanda Ripley.

Favorite pre-game pump-up song: “Our team likes to play Body by Loud Luxury on the bus to games.”

Favorite pre-game meal: “The night before a game I like to eat pasta and chicken. It’s a carb load with some protein.”

Person I most admire, and why: “My parents because they are very hardworking and set a great example for me they support and encourage me in anything I do, they are truly the best parents.”"

“We’re honored to support the health workers and first responders who are on the frontline of keeping our communities safe,” Richard Harding, the senior vice president of marketing and sales for BP’s North America fuels business, said in a statement on Saturday.

“We’re here to help keep them moving so they can continue their life-saving work,” he continued.

BP said in a release that the discount will be offered to “workers verified through ID.me, a digital identity verification system.”

The oil giant also said that ampm stores, a convenience store brand owned by BP, will be offering emergency service workers and hospital staff that provide their “official ID in store” free coffee, fountain drinks, or hot dogs, starting Monday.

The corporation said the store chain will be also be providing “discounted meal bundles to those in need” as part of the initiative.

The efforts announced by BP on Saturday follow a string of other moves made by the global oil and gas company in recent weeks to support coronavirus relief efforts across the world.

In China, where the novel coronavirus was first detected last year, the company said its staff planted vegetables in Zhejiang Province, an area hit hard by the pandemic, that it said it offered to local residents for free late last month.

Earlier this month, the company also said it supplied free fuel for the helicopters of four ambulance charities in England and Wales through its aviation division, BP Air, to help provide support to medical crews combatting the COVID-19 outbreak."

For the safety of people during the coronavirus, many houses of worship are currently closed.

The Sunday church bells are usually followed by a congregation, but, for almost a month, many churches have sat empty.

“It’s tough. It’s sad,” said one lady who stopped by St. Paul Cathedral in Oakland.

Palm Sunday was no different.

St. Paul’s doors were locked with a message saying the church is closed. There was no congregation to received the traditionally blessed palm.

“Tried to think of something palm symbolic that I could bring,” said a lady who left behind tall grass leaves.

To reach out to their congregations, churches continue to use technology. The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh live-streamed Bishop David Zubik’s mass from St. Paul Seminary in the West End.

“First of all whether you are near or far, I just wanted to say how blessed it is today as we begin this Holy Week,” Bishop Zubik said during his homily.

Meanwhile, in the Hill District, the Wesley Center AME Zion Church took their services to the streets.

“The church is grieving because we haven’t had services in 3 Sundays,” Rev. Glenn Grayson said.

Rev. Grayson stood along Centre Avenue in a mask and gloves handing out communion and palm.

“It’s not conventional, but it’s been wonderful and fulfilling for me,” he said while passing out the palm.

Even though the pews may sit empty during Holy Week and into Easter, church leaders feel the church’s message will fill their congregation’s hearts.

“Maybe you cancel it physically but spiritually Easter goes with us all year long,” Rev. Grayson said."

It is a story of history, hope, survival and resilience, which has its roots in another time when the world was convulsed by crisis – World War II.

This year marks the 75th anniversary of the end of that war and of the liberation of concentration camps across Europe. Most of the survivors who remain are now in their 80s and 90s. Soon there will be no one left who experienced the horrors of the Holocaust firsthand, no one to answer questions or bear witness to future generations. But a new and dramatic effort is underway to change that. Harnessing the technologies of the present and the future, it keeps alive the ability to talk to, and get answers from, the past.

Correspondent Lesley Stahl's interview with Holocaust survivor Aaron Elster, who spent two years of his childhood hidden in a neighbor's attic, was unlike any interview she had ever done.

""Aaron, tell us what your parents did before the war,"" Stahl asked Elster.

""They owned and operated a butcher shop,"" Elster said.

It wasn't the content of the interview that was so unusual.

""Where did you live?"" Stahl asked.

""I was born in a small town in Poland called Sokolów Podlaski,"" Elster said.

It's the fact that this interview was with a man who was no longer alive. Aaron Elster died two years ago.

""I'm actually a recording,"" Elster said. ""I cannot answer that question.""

Heather Maio came up with the idea for this project.  She had worked on exhibits featuring Holocaust survivors for years and wanted future generations to have the same opportunity to interact with them as she'd had.

""I wanted to talk to a Holocaust survivor like I would today,"" Maio said. ""With that person sitting right in front of me and we were having a conversation.""

She knew that back in the 90s, after making the film ""Schindler's List,"" Steven Spielberg created a foundation named for the Hebrew word for the Holocaust – Shoah – to film and collect testimonies from as many survivors as possible. They have interviewed nearly 55,000 of them so far and have stored them at the University of Southern California. But Maio dreamed of something more dynamic, being able to actively converse with survivors after they're gone. And she figured, in the age of artificial intelligence tools like Siri and Alexa, the technology had to be creatable.

She brought the idea to Stephen Smith, executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, and now her husband. He loved it, but some of his colleagues weren't so sure.

""One of them looked at me,"" Maio said. ""She was, like, 'You wanna talk to dead people?'""

""And you said, '""Yes, because that's the point,'"" Stahl said.

""That's the point,"" Maio said.

""Well maybe people thought you're turning the Holocaust into something maybe hokey?"" Stahl asked.

""Yeah,"" Maio said. ""They said that, 'You're gonna Disney-fy the Holocaust.'""

""We had a lot of pushback on this project,"" Smith said. ""'Is it the right thing to do? What about the wellbeing of the survivors? Are we trying to keep them alive beyond their deaths?' Everyone had questions except for one group of people, the survivors themselves, who said, 'Where do I sign up? I would like to participate in this project.' No barriers to entry.""

The first survivor they signed up to do a trial run was a man named Pinchas Gutter, who was born in Poland and deported to the Majdanek concentration camp with his parents and twin sister Sabina at the age of 11. He is the only one who survived. They flew Gutter from his home in Toronto to Los Angeles, and asked him to sit inside a giant lattice-like dome.

""Yeah, I call it a sphere,"" Gutter said. ""They call it a dome. And then eventually, it was called a bubble.""

A bubble surrounding him with lights and more than 20 cameras. The goal was to future-proof the interviews so that as technology advances and 3D, hologram-like projection becomes the norm, they'll have all the necessary angles.

""So the very first day we went to film Pinchas, we had these ultra high speed cameras,"" Smith said. ""They were all linked together and synced together to make this video of him. So we sit down and they press record. Nothing happens. So Pinchas is sitting there with 6,000 LED lights on him and cameras that don't work.""

""I was bored sitting in that chair, So I started singing to myself,"" Gutter said. ""So suddenly, Steven had this idea, 'Oh, he's singing. We're gonna record some songs of his.'""

Both Smith and Maio said Gutter was a good sport. Eventually the cameras rolled and Gutter was asked to come back to the bubble for the real thing.

""How long were you in that chair?"" Stahl asked him.

""A whole week from 9:00 to 5:00,"" Gutter said. ""We were there with breaks for lunch. And-- but I was there from 9:00 to 5:00 answering questions.""

It took so long because they asked him nearly 2000 questions. The idea was to cover every conceivable question anyone might ever want to ask him.

""Did you have to look exactly the same?"" Stahl asked.

""I had to wear the same clothes and I had three pairs of the same jackets, the same shirts, the same trousers, the same shoes,"" Gutter said.

Gutter can now be seen -- in those shirts, trousers, and shoes -- at Holocaust museums in Dallas, Indiana, and at the Illinois Holocaust Museum in Skokie, outside Chicago, where visitors can ask him their own questions.

""What kept you going,"" one girl asked, ""or what gave you hope while you were experiencing hardship in the camps?""

""We did hope that the Nazis would lose the war,"" Gutter's digital image responded.

Gutter's image is projected onto an 11-foot high screen. Smith explained how the technology works.

""So what's happening is all of the answers to the questions that Pinchas gave go into a database,"" Smith said. ""And when you ask a question, the algorithm is looking through all of the database, 'Do I have an answer to that.' And then it'll bring back what it thinks is the closest answer to your question.""

""Did you have a happy childhood?"" Stahl asked.

""I had a very happy childhood,"" Gutter's digital image said. ""My parents were winemakers. My father started teaching me to become a winemaker when I was 3-and-a-half years old. By the age of 5, I could already read and I could already write.""

""Thank you,"" Gutter's digital image said with a laugh.

""I've noticed there's a little jiggle right before Pinchas starts to talk,"" Stahl said. ""What is that?""

 

""What you're seeing here isn't a human being,"" Smith said. ""It's video clips that are-- that are being butted up to each other and played. And as it searches and brings the clip in, you just-- you're seeing a little bit of a jump cut.""

The jump cuts stopped being distracting once Stahl asked about the fate of Gutter's family.

""Tell us what happened when you got to the camp,"" Stahl said.

""As soon as we arrived there, we were being separated into different groups,"" Gutter's digital image said. ""And my sister was somehow pushed towards the children. And I saw her, she must have spotted my mother. So she ran towards my mother. I saw my mother. And she hugged her. And since that time, all I can remember whenever I think of my sister is her long-- big, long, blonde braid.""

That was the last time he saw his twin sister, Sabina. He learned later that day that she and both his parents had been killed in the gas chambers. Pinchas Gutter was alone at age 11, put to work as a slave laborer.

""Did you ever see anybody killed?"" Stahl asked.

""Unfortunately, I saw many people die in front of my eyes,"" Gutter's digital image said.

Stahl wasn't sure how a recording would handle what she wanted to ask him next.

""How can you still have faith in God?"" Stahl asked.

""How can you possibly not believe in God?"" Gutter's digital image said.

""Well,"" Stahl said, ""how did he let this happen?""

""God gave human beings the knowledge of right and wrong and he allowed them to do what they wished on this earth, to find their own way,"" Gutter's digital image said. ""To my mind, when God sees what human beings are up to, especially things like genocide, he weeps.""

""Wow. Stephen, I could ask him questions for ten hours,"" Stahl said.

Since Pinchas Gutter was filmed, the Shoah Foundation has recorded interviews with 21 more Holocaust survivors, each for a full week. And they've shrunk the set-up required, so they can take a mobile rig on the road to record survivors close to where they live.  They've deliberately chosen interview subjects with all different wartime experiences. Survivors of Auschwitz, hidden children, and as we saw last fall in New Jersey, 93-year-old Alan Moskin, who isn't a holocaust survivor. He was a liberator.

""Entering that camp was the most horrific sight I've ever seen or ever hope to see the rest of my life,"" Moskin said.

Moskin was an 18-year-old private when his Army unit liberated a little-known concentration camp called Gunskirchen.

""There was a pile of skeleton-like bodies on the left,"" Moskin said. ""There was another pile of skeleton-like bodies on the right. 'Those poor souls.' That's the term my lieutenant kept screaming, 'Oh my God, look at these poor souls.'""

""I remember the expression and the attitude of all of us,"" Moskin continued. ""'What in the freak? What is this? God almighty'""

Each of Alan Moskin's answers is then isolated by a team of researchers at the Shoah Foundation Office. They add into the system a variety of questions people might ask to trigger that response.

""For every question that we asked, there are 15 different ways of asking the same question,"" Maio said. ""And that's all manual.""

Editors rotate the image, turn the green screen background into black and then a long process of testing begins, some of it in schools.

Students are asked to try it out. Ask whatever questions they want and see if the system calls up the correct answer.

""How did you find out that your city was getting invaded by Germany?"" One student asked.

""How did you feel about your family?"" Another asked.

Pinchas Gutter's digital image responded to one student by asking, ""Can you rephrase that, please?""

Every question and response is then reviewed.

""We log every single question that's asked of the system,"" Maio said. ""And see if there is a better response that addresses that question more directly.""

As Stahl's crew discovered, it's still a work in progress.

""Tell us about your family when you were a little boy,"" Stahl asked Gutter's digital image.

""How about you ask me about life after the war?"" The digital image answered back.

""So, couple of things about artificial intelligence,"" Smith said. ""It is mainly artificial and not so intelligent.""

""Just yet, for now,"" Maio said.

""But the beauty of artificial intelligence is it develops over time,"" Smith said. ""So we aren't changing the content. All the answers remain the same. But over time, the range of questions that you can ask will be enhanced considerably.""

Questions to draw out what it was like for Aaron Elster hiding in that attic 75 years ago.

""I used to pray to God to let me live 'til I was 25,"" Elster's digital image said. ""I wanted to taste what adulthood would be like. So, am I a lucky guy? Yes I am.""

Of more than 20 men and women who have participated so far in the project, three have already passed away. Stahl had conversations with two of them, conversations that at times felt so normal, she said she could almost forget she was talking with the digital image of someone no longer living.

First, a spunky 4'9"" woman named Eva Kor, an identical twin who, together with her sister, survived Auschwitz and the notorious experiments of Dr. Josef Mengele. Kor spent her life after the war in Terre Haute, Indiana.  She died last summer at the age of 85.

""Hi, Eva. How are you today?"" Stahl asked.

""I'm fine, and how are you?"" Kor's digital image said back.

Stahl said it felt natural to answer Kor's question before posing her own.

""So how old were you when you went to Auschwitz?"" Stahl asked.

""When I arrived in Auschwitz, I was ten years old,"" Kor's digital image said. ""And I stayed in Auschwitz until liberation, which was about nine months later when we were liberated.""

""So we made a little announcement about the fact we were starting this project,"" Smith said. ""I get a call the next day from a lady called Eva Kor. I didn't know her at that point in time. And she says, 'I want to be one of those 3D interviews.'""

""I said, 'Well, I'm traveling, I'm very sorry,'"" Smith said. ""'Where're you going?' 'Oh, well, I've got to go to New York. I'm going to D.C.' 'When are you gonna go to D.C.? I'm going to D.C.' Turns out we were going to the same event in D.C. I arrive at my hotel, she's sitting in the lobby, waiting for me.""

When Eva, on the right, and her twin sister, Miriam arrived at Auschwitz, they were pulled away from their parents and older sisters and taken to a barrack full of twins. They never saw their family again.

60 Minutes reported on Mengele's twin experiments in a story back in 1992, and Stahl actually interviewed the living Eva Kor at her home in Terre Haute. Eva told Stahl then about becoming extremely sick after an injection.

""Mengele came in every morning and every evening, with four other doctors,"" Kor said in 1992. ""And he declared, very sarcastically, laughing, 'Too bad.  She's so young. She has only 2 weeks to live.'""

""When I heard that, I knew he was right and I immediately made a silent pledge that I would prove you, Dr. Mengele, wrong,"" Kor's digital image said in the present.

Imagine, picking up a conversation almost 30 years later -- and after Eva Kor's death.

""Eva, tell us about Dr. Mengele,"" Stahl asked. ""What was he like?""

""He had a gorgeous face, a movie star face, and very pleasant, actually. Dark hair, dark eyes,"" Kor's digital image said. ""When I looked into his eyes, I could see nothing but evil. People say that the eyes are the center of the soul, and in Mengele's case, that was correct.""

Eva and Miriam are visible in footage taken by the Soviet forces that liberated Auschwitz 75 years ago.  

They went back to the camp many times, Eva continuing to go even after Miriam's death in 1993. It was on one of those visits that Eva made a stunning announcement that she had decided to forgive her Nazi captors.

""I, Eva Moses Kor, hereby give amnesty to all Nazis who participated,"" Kor said at the time.

She came under blistering attack from other survivors.

""How can you forgive? How is that possible?"" Stahl asked Kor's digital image.

""My forgiveness does not mean that I forget what happened, which is impossible,"" Kor's digital image said. ""My forgiveness is an act of self-healing, self-liberation, and self-empowerment.""

""I cannot forgive,"" Elster's digital image said. ""For them to get forgiveness, they have to ask my little sister, Sarah, whom they brutally murdered. I have no right to forgive, and I will not forgive.""

""What's important for me in this project is that we have Holocaust survivors who have different points of view about God and religion and faith and forgiveness,"" Stephen Smith said. ""And that's what this project will allow us to do.""

Aaron Elster, unlike many Holocaust survivors, never spent time in a concentration camp. As Jews were being rounded up in his town's marketplace and sent to Treblinka, his father told him to run. He was 9 years old.

""And I managed to crawl into the sewer that ran along the marketplace, the street,"" Elster's digital image said. ""And kept crawling 'til I felt I was outta sight, stood up and started running.""

He made it to the building of an older Polish couple named the Gurskis who'd been customers at his family's butcher shop.

""He shows up. And she didn't wanna take him,"" Heather Maio said. ""He started crying. And then she led him upstairs.""

""Aaron, how long did you stay in the attic?"" Stahl asked.

""I lived in that attic for close to two years,"" Elster's digital image said.

Two years with just one visit a day to bring food and water.

""What was it like in the attic?"" Stahl asked.

""Oh, there's so many things that I remember, the hunger, the fear, the absolute, total loneliness,"" Elster's digital image said. ""What do you do all day? You're sitting there. I used to catch flies, outta desperation, and tear their wings off, so they wouldn't fly away, so I had them there.""

""How did you survive?"" Stahl asked. ""How did you survive in that attic?""

""I had the ability to daydream,"" Elster's digital image said. ""I used to write novels in my head. I was the hero all the time. And we have that ability to either give in to our misery and our pain and die or absorb the physical pain by keep your mentality, keep your soul, keep your mind. So was I bored? Was I scared? Was I in need of somebody to accept me or to tell me that I'm okay, that I'm a nice kid? Sure. But that was not part of my life.""

""We got a phone call to say that Aaron Elster had suddenly passed away,"" Smith said. ""I was at a conference at that time. So the next morning, I went into the-- little room that we had, and I turned on Aaron Elster's testimony. And I realized I was gonna be the first person ever to click that little button and ask a question of somebody who was no longer alive. And for the next six hours, people came in and outta that room. His funeral had not yet taken place, and yet the legacy was already continuing. And it was a very powerful and touching moment.""

A touching moment that may soon be available to others beyond the community of Holocaust survivors. Heather Maio says in the process of developing and testing this technology, she was barraged with inquiries.

""There wasn't one person, literally not one, that didn't ask me if they could do a similar interview with either a loved one, for themselves,"" Maio said.

""Unrelated, completely unrelated,"" Maio said. ""'Can I do this with someone that I know?'""

She has started an independent company that is trying to expand the use of this technology. Recording interviews with other historical figures like astronauts, and eventually with anyone at all.

""So do you think that this is just gonna be a tool that people will use?"" Stahl asked. ""Everybody will be recording their histories?""

""And other people can interview them?"" Stahl asked. ""It'll just be life?""

For now, though, the race is on to capture interviews with as many Holocaust survivors as possible while there's still time, so the conversations can continue, always, with people like Aaron Elster.

""Do you want revenge?"" Stahl asked Elster's digital image.

""When I was a youngster I wanted revenge very very, very much, and I hated. I hated,"" Elster's digital image said. ""But most of the perpetrators, most of the killers are dead. So who am I going to hate? The grandchildren that had nothing to do with? It's not right. Revenge is not part of my life, not part of my thinking.""

""You know, here you have these people who were basically destined to be annihilated,"" Stahl said to Stephen Smith. ""That they survived is the miracle. But they were supposed to be murdered, killed. And now they have immortality.""

""They were not supposed to have a name,"" Smith said. ""They were supposed to be destroyed for all time. And now, through this program, they will be able to continue to answer questions hundreds of years after the Nazis have gone.""

""It's that 'never forget,'"" Stahl said.

 

""We've had a lot of clichés around the Holocaust. You know, 'Never again, never forget, we must remember,' all this sort of thing,"" Smith said. ""What this does, it makes sure that there isn't closure because it's not about a statement. It's not about a particular thing that's being instructed of you. The onus is on you to ask the questions. The onus is on you to be curious, and to want to know. And so in a sense, it turns the learning on its head and says, ""'I'm not gonna tell you what the lessons of the Holocaust are. I'm not gonna tell you what the Holocaust means. But if you want to find out, then you can ask.'""

So there we were, at a special moment in time when the living Pinchas Gutter could talk to the one who will live forever.

""Would you ask you a question for us?"" Stahl asked Gutter.

""I will ask the one which is my favorite,"" Gutter said. ""Can you sing me a song from your youth?""

""You want me to sing it for you?"" Gutter's digital image responded.

""Yes, please,"" Gutter said.

With that, Gutter's digital image began to sing in Polish, with the live Gutter joining in.

""What does that mean?"" Stahl asked. ""What is the song? Is it a happy song?""

""Yeah, well, it's a happy song,"" Gutter said. ""It's like a brother and a sister, which of course, my twin sister-- are traveling in the woods or on the-- on the road, and they can't get over how beautiful the world is."""

(CBS) — From the Vatican to the Delaware Valley, Palm Sunday mass was celebrated online. The coronavirus outbreak has shut out the faithful from the churches but not from the word of God.

“Jail without bars,” a parishioner said.

That’s how parishioners describe the new norm.

“Never saw anything like it, and I’m 86,” a Delaware County woman said. “They put the palms in plastic bags so nobody would touch them.”

Those palms now a symbol of the times.

The faithful collected them one by one with their hands and sometimes with their faces protected.

“It’s Palm Sunday and that’s tradition,” a parishioner said. “It’s when our Lord entered into Jerusalem.”

Religious leaders at Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish tried to offer some comfort to Christians on the start of the Holy Week, while still keeping in mind concerns over COVID-19.

“Palms are very important because we will go home and maybe make a cross to keep in the house,” Anthony DeCurtis said.

“We are so appreciative of our pastor,” Sonia DeCurtis said.

Not all churches in the area are taking part in the traditional Sunday as leaders try to encourage their members to adhere to stay-at-home mandates and social distancing recommendations.

“It’s extremely sad, but it’s part of our present reality,” Father Dennis Gill said.

The pews inside the Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter Paul in Center City were empty but worship continued virtually.


“I would encourage people if they cannot take advantage of participating at a distance by watching it streamed on their computers or television screen, they can certainly participate by reading sacred scriptures assigned to that day,” Gill said.

He says the distribution of the palm will happen at a future date.

That is a call many others are making as they turn to preach online.

Back in Havertown, parishioners say these are troubling times but through faith, they will persevere

“We will get through it,” a parishioner said.

In New Jersey, the Diocese of Camden has asked members to put branches on their front door or windows since they cannot receive palms.

That is just one way that churches are trying to keep the faith as Easter approaches."

She was 91.

The news of Fierro’s death was reported by the Martha’s Vineyard Times. According to Kevin Ryan, artistic director and board president for Island Theatre Workshop, she was living in an assisted living facility in Ohio when she died. Fierro was a supporter of the Island Theatre Workshop for over 40 years during her time on Martha’s Vineyard. She was also a drama teacher and mentor at the Island Theatre Workshop.

In Steven Spielberg’s iconic 1975 horror Jaws, Fierro played the role of Alex Kintner’s (Jeffrey Voorhees) mother who was killed by the titular shark. In a memorable scene, she is mourning her son’s death and walks up to Roy Scheider’s Brody and slaps him after learning he knew that a girl was killed after a shark attack. “You knew it was dangerous, but you let people go swimming anyway,” she told him while crying. “You knew all those things and still my boy is dead now, and there’s nothing you can do about it. My boy is dead. I wanted you to know that.” She went on to reprise her role in  1987’s Jaws: The Revenge.

A small service is planned by Fierro’s family in Ohio with a memorial service in Martha’s Vineyard at a later date."

She was 86.

Douglas’s son, actor Kiefer Sutherland, took to Twitter to announce the unfortunate news. “Early this morning my mother, Shirley Douglas, passed away due to complications surrounding pneumonia (not related to COVID-19),” Sutherland wrote. “My mother was an extraordinary woman who led an extraordinary life. Sadly she had been battling for her health for quite some time and we, as a family, knew this day was coming. To any families who have lost loved ones unexpectedly to the coronavirus, my heart breaks for you. Please stay safe.”

Douglas was born on April 2, 1934 in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. Her acting career kicked off in 1950 at the Regina Little Theatre. She graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London in 1952 and worked in England before returning to Canada in 1957.

She has appeared in films from acclaimed filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick’s Lolita (1962) and David Cronenberg’s Dead Ringers (1988). Her other features included Shadow Dancing (1988), Mesmer (1994) and The Stone Angel (2007). On the TV side, she appeared in Wind at My Back (1996) and Shadow Lake (1999) a TV film for which she won a Gemini Award. She starred alongside Sutherland in a 1997 production of The Glass Menagerie at the Royal Alexandra Theatre and at the National Arts Centre. She also performed in The Vagina Monolgues in 2000.

As an activist, she was part of the American Civil Rights Movement, which campaigned against the Vietnam War. She was an ally to immigrants, advocated for women and established the fundraising group “Friends of the Black Panthers”.  She also was an advocate for publicly funded healthcare over privatized care in Canada. She was also named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2003."

Politicians have promised their citizens a “return to normal” following the pandemic. However understandable, this longing for “normal” will lead us to a mirage. Worse, our recovery from COVID-19 could be a short-lived victory if we aspire only to have a “normal” economy again. 

Normal created a climate change timebomb that may make the economic consequences of coronavirus look mild by comparison. Normal would give two brutal dictators the power to topple North America’s fossil fuel industry whenever they feel like it. 

Normal also caused the mass destruction of ecosystems, human desperation for animal protein and increased human-wildlife contact. Combined, these factors led to Ebola, Hanta, bird flu, SARS, MERS and now COVID-19 to find a new, more plentiful host in human beings. 

Stimulus spending around the world has already eclipsed the 2009 recovery measures and “New Deal” programs of the 1930s. And more spending is inevitable. Will your taxpayer money be wasted on a return to normal? Or, could it be used to create a new roaring 20s and an economy that thrives for decades to come?


The Oil End Game

Normal is no longer desirable or secure in the fossil fuel industry. In late February 2020, as stock markets tumbled and Asian oil demand evaporated, Russia and OPEC were still coordinating production levels under an agreement known as OPEC+. It was formed, ostensibly, to counter the American shale oil boom, which had turned the U.S. into the world’s largest producer.

In early March, at a meeting in OPEC’s headquarters in Vienna, Saudi Arabia proposed that OPEC+ slice production by 1 million barrels, with Russia shouldering half the cut. Russia refused, so Saudi Arabia retaliated by starting a price war.  


A month later, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (aka, MBS) and Russian President Vladimir Putin still seem unwilling to back down. Thanks to their spat and the pandemic recession, WTI crude is trading around $25 per barrel, which is at least $15 below the breakeven price for the typical North American oil well.  The situation is even worse in the Canadian oil sands where, as The Financial Post put it, Canadian heavy oil is now “cheaper than a pint of beer.” Most U.S. and Canadian producers will not be able to survive—which is part of why Putin is in no rush to negotiate with MBS. 

Saudi Arabia and Russia seem to be initiating the “Oil End Game.” Even before the pandemic, Michael Liebreich, energy consultant and founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, predicted that petroleum demand would peak and fall before 2030. The transition from fossil fuels to clean energy is bound to kill demand for petroleum, the lifeblood of these two countries. Saudi Arabia and Russia need to be among the last countries to pump oil out of the ground. 

Autocrats on Autopilot

Yet, Saudi Arabia and Russia cannot sustain $25 oil for long without consequences either. The Kingdom requires about $83 USD oil to balance its budget, while Russia’s breakeven price is around $42. 

MBS’s long-term strategy, Saudi 2030 Vision, plans to diversify the economy off oil funded by—you guessed it—oil. Saudi Arabia needs a new economy in place before the energy transition happens. Without strong oil revenues, though, Saudi Arabia cannot pull off Vision 2030, nor can it continue to generously subsidize its citizens.

Two-thirds of the Saudi population works for the government. Half the population is under 25 years old, and youth unemployment fluctuates between 25% and 30%. A protracted price war could spur social unrest and a backlash against the royal family, which is known for its lavish spending. 

Nor is Putin in a position to sustain the price war. If he wants to be ruler for life, as he has made clear, then he needs to reverse declining living standards in Russia. That will require massive increases in public spending that Russia cannot afford if oil prices stay too low for too long. 

Meanwhile, eager to create some positive economic news, President Trump tweeted on April 2nd that he had brokered a deal between Putin and MBS, which sent oil prices soaring. North American oil CEOs expressed relief. But so far, Russia hasn’t reached its limit in the price war yet, and the OPEC+ meeting scheduled for Monday, April 6 to discuss a possible deal has been cancelled.  

Don’t be surprised to see an agreement on supply cuts soon, but don’t be fooled. The demand for petroleum is projected to fall 20% in April. Hence, any kind of agreement may be a cheap play by MBS and Putin to please their friend Trump, while knowing that storage facilities are reaching capacity. As long as demand doesn’t pick up unexpectedly, their oil has nowhere to go. The moment that changes they will start pumping again, and more oil players in the U.S. and Canada will face financially unattractive consolidation or even bankruptcy.  

There is no return to normal for the shale and oil sands producers. From now on, the fate of the oil industry is tied to the whims of two egomaniacal autocrats. Demand will continue to decrease as low-cost renewables keep pushing the energy transition.

Not a Time to Celebrate

There are certainly mixed emotions in the cleantech community. Of course we want to see the energy transition succeed and the oil industry fade. But no one in their right mind wants that transition to happen at the expense of vulnerable communities. 

As of 2018, Canada’s oil, gas and coal sectors sector directly employed over 269,000 people and indirectly supports 550,000 jobs. In the United States, those three sectors employ at least 1.6 million people. The energy transition will create new, higher-paying jobs. But right now, the green economy cannot create new jobs faster than the oil industry is shedding old ones.  

Thus, Canada and the United States are in a bind. There is a temptation to bail out oil, if only to keep people employed and ensure that these over leveraged companies don’t drag banks underwater. 

Financial support for oil workers is an imperative, but support for the oil sector is a waste of money, whether the Saudis and Russians stay their course or not. Investments in shale and the Canadian oil sands are bound to become stranded assets, even if we return to “normal.” Oil’s days were numbered before coronavirus, and they will be numbered after it.   

A Future Better than Normal

It makes no sense to revive a dying oil industry only to kill it again a few years later. It makes no sense to recreate jobs that will not survive the energy transition. Fossil fuels are in decline despite already enjoying billions in government subsidies. Saudi Arabia and Russia will retain the power to drive North American producers out of business whenever it suits them. There is no scenario where fossil fuels make a full and sustained recovery from this crisis.

In the near term, North American politicians must prioritize food, shelter and safety for out-of-work citizens. Longer term, though, if politicians are going to inject trillions of taxpayer dollars into reviving the North American economy, here’s a thought: allocate taxpayer money to companies that are creating the future, not doing CPR on the past.

Now is the time to invest in nuclear fusion, the holy grail of energy. Now is the time to expand global energy storage and electric vehicle infrastructure. Now is the time to invest in carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCSU). Now is the time to build high-voltage power lines that can bring clean energy from regions of abundance to areas of scarcity. Now is the time to repurpose fossil fuels for advanced new materials and food solutions. And now is the time to ramp up green hydrogen. 

Let’s not misuse taxpayer money to rebuild an economy that survives COVID-19 and then succumbs to climate change. Instead, let’s create a future economy with good jobs, a habitable earth and reprieve from the whims of erratic dictators. There is no path back to normal. And we can do much, much better than normal if we refuse to waste this crisis."

Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a video on Sunday.

The company is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week.

""Our first shipment was delivered to Kaiser hospital facilities in the Santa Clara Valley this past week and the feedback from doctors was very positive.""

Cook said that Apple's face shield design can be packed 100 to a box and can be assembled in two minutes.

Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Cook also said that Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.

Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Apple's corporate employees in California are currently working from home and its retail stores outside of China are closed indefinitely."

That's more jobs lost than in the 18 months of the Great Recession. Those sidelined by coronavirus include business owners at the height of their success, Americans who never imagined asking for help and those who believed we would never again explore the depths of the 1930s. Coast-to-coast, the economy is in critical condition with workers idled at Boeing, General Motors, Ford, GE, Marriott and Macy's. But the largest job losses will likely come from the biggest employer of all: small business.

Melba Wilson: When I look around at my dining room of 109 people. We normally see a lot of life. Right now, I see despair.

Three weeks ago, you were lucky to get a table at Melba's in Harlem.

Melba Wilson: I started Melba's 16 years ago with money that I saved up under my mattress.

Melba Wilson: Literally, under the mattress. So, I grew up watching my mother doing that. And I emulated it.

Saving, sacrifice, and Carolina cooking made Melba Wilson a hit. Now, she's laid off 24 employees. Melba's is restricted to take out and delivery, like New York City's other 27,000 restaurants, overall one of the city's largest employers.

Melba Wilson: Well, if you're looking at the bigger picture across New York, you're looking at restaurants, you're looking at nightlife and you're looking at almost a half a million people that don't have jobs, that cannot feed their families, that cannot pay their bills, that don't know where their next meals are coming from. That's despair. That's devastation.

How much devastation is estimated by economists as an eventual unemployment rate between 10% and 30%. We found the numbers would be higher if state unemployment offices were not overwhelmed.

Department of Labor recording: ""All specialists are busy with other customers. You must call back this week.""

Kaitlyn Reynolds: I've done that 50 times, every day, for two weeks.

Two weeks ago, Kaitlyn Reynolds was a vice president of a firm that organizes business conferences. She filed for unemployment online but discovered her last step, in New York, is a mandatory phone call.

Kaitlyn Reynolds: Fifty times a day since March 16th to get through to the contact center for unemployment to continue my claim and I have not yet been able to get through.

Guy Hillel: You would go two or three pages in, and it would throw you out, would tell you that-- you know, ""Session is timed out."" You-- then you do-- go six pages in; again, it will throw you out. ""This session is timed out."" You would go all the way to the end, press ""submit."" You press submit and it will tell you ""Session is timed out.""

Time ran out on the hotel where Hillel was a manager. A native of Israel, he worked in hospitality for 20 years. When his 500-room, Times Square hotel closed, he went home to his wife, two children and a new occupation: connecting with the unemployment office.

Guy Hillel: After I think ten days, I was able to submit and go to the next step, which was a phone call.

CALL CENTER: ""Your call cannot be completed as dialed.""

No one at the unemployment office is answering his call either.

Department of Labor New York Hotline: 'We are experiencing a high volume of calls at this time.' Guy Hillel: ""And, they hung me up.""

His credit card company is giving him a break for 90 days. No such luck with his car payment.

Scott Pelley: What is it like, after so many years in your industry, bringing home a paycheck every week? What is it like that you're not doing that now?

Guy Hillel: It hurts your pride, in a way, you know? Sleepless night. You wake up in the middle of the night, thinking, worrying, ""What will be next? How can we-- how can we get to the next step?""

Scott Pelley: Have you ever applied for unemployment before?

Scott Pelley: How do you feel about it?

Kaitlyn Reynolds: At first I was embarrassed I've worked since I was 15. I've always put work above anything else. I've never-- I never thought I would be in a position like this where I would need to ask for help.

Scott Pelley: Are you a month away from being broke? Two months away?

It may take a month or more for the largest government bailout in history to show much effect. Federally-backed emergency small business loans will become available through banks, but demand is likely to cause delay, like those calls to the unemployment office. Melba Wilson applied for a loan. Her employees are waiting.

Alysha Navarro: It was devastating. I was heartbroken, I was scared. Scared for me and scared for my daughter.

Alysha Navarro was laid off at Melba's after two years. She's single with a one-and-a-half-year-old daughter and a list of questions.

Alysha Navarro: Can I feed my family? How can I pay bills? You wonder if this last three or four months, am I gonna become homeless?

Unemployment benefits have been temporarily increased for the emergency—about double in many states. But even that leaves Navarro about $2,000 a month short.    

 

Alysha Navarro: This month, I won't be able to pay my cable, and I won't be able to pay my phone bill.

Scott Pelley: You got the rent covered?

Alysha Navarro: Definitely have the rent covered for this month, but I don't-- I have it covered for the next two months. But after that, what do I do?

New York ordered a 90 day stop on evictions. Nationwide, foreclosures on federally-backed mortgages are delayed 60 days. Like most Americans, Alysha Navarro is expecting a one-time check of $1,200 from the bailout fund and $500 for her daughter, but those checks are likely six or eight weeks away. As Kaitlyn Reynolds found, the safety net wasn't meant to catch so many millions at once.

Scott Pelley: You know, I'm curious. Would you try the unemployment office again?

Kaitlyn Reynolds: Yeah, absolutely. Let me pull up the number.

Department of Labor recording: We're sorry. We are experiencing an extremely high volume of calls at this time.

The 'high volume of calls' is 1.3 million a day, the state office told us. It's completing 61,000 applications a day.

Like other states, New York is attempting to spread calls across different days of the week based on the applicant's last name. The state is training another 200 reinforcements, some will take calls from home.

Danny Meyer: This virus has, for me, been almost like a hurricane with no wind, or a forest fire with no flame.

Danny Meyer is among New York's most successful restaurateurs. He started the Shake Shack chain and runs 20 other restaurants.

Scott Pelley: How many people have you laid off?

Danny Meyer: We've laid off over 2,000 people by now.

Restaurant jobs are the most vulnerable in the crisis. Retail is second.

Danny Meyer: There's about 660,000 restaurants in America. you can do the math on how many human beings are actively working, producing something of real value by bringing people together, and they're out of work right now.

The math is 12 million jobs in restaurants, which Meyer explained is only the start.

Danny Meyer: Then you start to look at all the concentric circles, the people that do our flowers, the people that deliver the bread, the people who fish for our fish. We know from the farmers in the greenmarket that, if people are not gathering, and restaurants are not open, how do you know what to plant? You don't go to the trouble of planting a crop only to have it go fallow.

Factories are fallow too. Manufacturing output is dropping at the fastest rate since the Great Recession. 

 

Michael Bednark: We employed about 120 full-time employees at Bednark Studio.

Michael Bednark owns a Brooklyn Design and Fabrication company that makes displays for retailers.

Michael Bednark: We laid off about 25% of our staff, about 30 people. We made, basically a pay-cut across the board for everyone, so a wage reduction.

His factory builds in wood, glass, metal and plastic. He has enough contracts at the moment to last about a month and a half.

Michael Bednark: We sort of just were trying to stay positive, find a way to get through six weeks. And hopefully on the other side there'd be something to do.

Scott Pelley: And you found a way.

Overnight, working with a partner, Bednark is now manufacturing gear for hospitals. The minimum pay here is $18 an hour. They're making 27,000 face shields a day. The New York Department of Health wants to buy half a million.

Scott Pelley: So you were forced to lay off about 30 people. And now you've hired how many?

Michael Bednark: We've probably hired close to 100 ourselves. There's probably about 300 to 400 people working on this project. We have truck drivers and we have-- then we have auxiliary people working on it. Every day we get a new-- a lunch served by a local restaurant. They deliver 160 boxed lunches.

Scott Pelley: A restaurant that was closed except for takeout is now delivering 150 lunches to your face mask factory.

Michael Bednark: Yeah, our goal was to-- it's basically to keep the funds in Brooklyn, keep the funds in New York. Help people help others. So, by, you know, giving them a lunch, we can employ ten, 15 people at a restaurant each day.

We actually heard a lot of stories of empathy. Alysha Navarro from Melba's cooked up one way to help.

Alysha Navarro: I study how to do homemade hand sanitizers, Lysols, homemade masks to help people who are less, who are unfortunate, and who can't afford those things. And you can make them with everyday home supplies.

Danny Meyer started a non-profit charity making grants to his most needy former employees and Michael Bednark's people are sacrificing for each other.

Michael Bednark: We had some employees offering to split their weeks. So, they'd do 20 hours and then have their counterpart do 20 hours that week just to sort of keep people working and keep people busy and keep people getting paid.

Scott Pelley: You had employees volunteer to split their weeks with somebody who was less fortunate?

The best of these stories happened before our eyes.

Melba Wilson took an order for takeout from someone who wanted to remain anonymous. One hundred dinners to be delivered to nearby Mount Sinai Hospital. One voice on the phone joining a chorus of Americans longing for better days ahead.

Melba Wilson on the phone: I am so uplifted, first of all, by the fact that you are doing this for the medical staff and also that you are helping my employees. So, it means the world to me.

Caller: And your name is Melba? That obviously means you're the owner?

Melba Wilson on the phone: Yeah, my name is Melba, yeah, I just happen to be the owner. And thank you so much. And stay safe, may God continue to bless you. Thank you.

Melba Wilson on the phone: Ok, bye-bye.

Melba Wilson: My grandmother always told us, ""This too shall pass."" And it's times of, when, of trials and tribulation that I lean on my faith and I lean on my spirit. I don't know how. I don't know when. But believe me, this too shall pass."

The company had planned to restart those operations this week after a two-week suspension to help curtail the virus’ spread. Now those operations will remain closed indefinitely. 


            
            
        “These actions are being taken in light of the company's continuing focus on the health and safety of employees, current assessment of the spread of COVID-19 in Washington state, the reliability of the supply chain and additional recommendations from government health authorities,” Boeing (NYSE: BA) said in a press release. 


Spirit AeroSystems Inc. (NYSE: SPR) had late last month suspended most of its work in Wichita to mirror Boeing’s two-week shutdown. 


The company on Friday said that employees on those Boeing programs would begin reporting back to work Wednesday. 


A Spirit spokesperson wasn’t immediately available to say if Boeing’s new plan would extend the local work suspension as well. 


Spirit is Wichita’s largest employer with around 10,000 local workers. 


Boeing is its largest customer, accounting for around 80 percent of the supplier’s annual sales. The vast majority of Spirit's work for Boeing is connected to the facilities in Washington state.


Boeing said that it will continue to monitor government guidance on COVID-19 and that its sites still open elsewhere around the country will be re-evaluated daily."

Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appealed to the people of India to hold a nationwide candlelight vigil on Sunday at 9 p.m. local time, for nine minutes, in a show of solidarity for the country's fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

Modi said it is important for every Indian to realize that he or she isn't alone in this fight.

""We must together invoke the spirit of Bharat Mata (Mother India) and ensure that the dark clouds of the virus make way for the light hope,"" Modi said while addressing the nation on Friday.

Social media has lit up with images of the vigil. Photos posted online show President Ram Nath Kovind and the country's first lady with candles at the Presidential Palace. Prime Minister Modi was seen lighting a lamp at his residence.

Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohli and Bollywood stars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone were just some of the people across the country posting images online as they observed the vigil. For live updates on the coronavirus pandemic, go here"

It was a Monday morning, and the co-owner of Thamee, a Burmese restaurant in D.C. that had just been named a semifinalist for the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant, was doing his routine count of reservations for that evening. Usually, the number of bookings will rise between Sunday night and Monday morning, as guests making last-minute dinner plans sign up for tables online. On March 9, Wang saw the reservations drop by half overnight.



  



  



  
  Many restaurants operate on wafer-thin margins, with little financial cushion to sustain the business through prolonged periods of diminished income. Thamee, which opened in May 2019 and made the Washington Post’s list of best restaurants of that year, was no different. The restaurant had only just completed its first five straight weeks of profitability when those reservation cancellations started rolling in. Like many new restaurants, Thamee was still in debt, with just about one month’s worth of rent and one pay period’s worth of wages on hand. Wang, 39, and his Thamee co-owners—Simone Jacobson, 35, and her Burma-born mother, 67-year-old executive chef Jocelyn Law-Yone—had to act quickly to avoid bleeding money on hourly staffers who might show up at the restaurant to find empty tables and not enough work to do.



  



  
  The owners took one server off the schedule each night and had a bartender do double-duty serving tables. They dismissed members of the kitchen staff two hours early during every dinner service. As their customers began to avoid restaurants for fear of contracting or spreading the novel coronavirus, Thamee’s management could only try to keep the business afloat. At that point, Wang said, there was still no signal from government officials that public establishments should do anything differently to protect their employees or guests, or that there might be assistance coming for employees whose hours were dwindling. “There were no guidelines other than ‘wash your hands and don’t touch your face,’ ” Wang said. “For two weeks, that was really all we got, from the end of February to when the shit hit the fan.”



  



  



  



  
  Every town has had its own shit-hitting-fan moment in the coronavirus timeline, when official response escalates from personal hygiene PSAs to business closures and isolation mandates. For D.C., it came on Sunday, March 15, when Mayor Muriel Bowser handed down an order requiring restaurants to eliminate bar seating and keep 6-foot gaps between all tables. Thamee had finished its brunch service and was less than an hour from welcoming dinner guests—both meals with a smaller-than-usual crowd—when Jacobson, the only owner in the restaurant that day, got the word. “I just went into crisis mode,” she said.

  Jacobson pulled out a tape measure and started mapping out a new table configuration, reducing available seats from 40 to 12. She called seven staffers on the schedule and told them she couldn’t afford to bring them in for the evening; some didn’t get the message in time and were sent back home as soon as they arrived. “I had a bartender, two line cooks, and me—that’s it,” Jacobson said. “It wasn’t our best service ever, but we gave it our absolute best. It was a lot of chaos and confusion. And really, that day was sort of a blur, because we didn’t know what was going to happen next.”



  
  Here’s what happened next: Bowser banned dine-in service altogether on March 16, in an order that took effect just a few hours after it was issued. Some D.C. restaurants pivoted to takeout and delivery. Thamee management opted to close. All 28 employees, including the owners, have been out of work for more than two weeks, with no idea when they’ll be able to earn a paycheck again. Many have applied for unemployment benefits but have yet to receive any payouts. “That week, I felt like I lived a year in about seven days,” line cook Leeda Bijani, 26, told me. “I love being out in my city and working really hard. My livelihood, my happiness, my sanity is cooking and being in a kitchen. And it was gone overnight.”



  



  
  
  As the U.S. economy staggers under the weight of the coronavirus pandemic and its attendant lockdowns, the hospitality sector is hemorrhaging jobs and revenue. Thousands of restaurants around the country have shuttered or curtailed operations under orders from state and local officials. In a recent survey of 5,000 restaurant operators, the National Restaurant Association found that 44 percent had temporarily closed their businesses, 3 percent had permanently closed, and 11 percent projected that they’d have to close for good within the next month. The association estimates that 3 million restaurant workers were laid off in the first three weeks of March—about one-fifth of the entire U.S. restaurant workforce. April will look even worse.



  



  



  
  “It’s like you’re a parent, and suddenly someone waved a magic wand and said, ‘Your previous toddler human child is now an armadillo. Figure it out.’ ”
    
      — Simone Jacobson
    



  
  This gutting hasn’t been distributed evenly across the industry. Spending at fine dining restaurants has dropped 98 percent from the pre-coronavirus average. Chain restaurants—which are more likely to have drive-through or takeout options—are faring better: Fast-food restaurants, for instance, have only seen a 45 percent decline in spending. For a small, mid-to-upscale independent restaurant like Thamee, abruptly converting to a takeout and delivery operation was a tall order. At first, Wang thought it might work: The restaurant could keep just the salaried staff members on board to cook, package, and deliver food. When Thamee bar manager Richard Sterling, 34, heard that the D.C. Council had passed emergency legislation to allow restaurants to sell wine, beer, and liquor with takeout and delivery orders, he saw it as an exciting challenge. “I was like, ‘Let’s go, let’s do this’—thinking about smaller portions of our cocktails, thinking about larger carafes we can seal,” he said.



  



  
  But when Wang, Jacobson, Law-Yone, Sterling, and general manager Jordan Lee sat down to talk through their options two days after the mayor’s order to end dine-in service, the prospect of hastily fashioning a takeout joint out of a restaurant known for its warm, familiar ambiance, lively open kitchen, and frequent tableside visits from the owners felt increasingly grim. The logistics alone were prohibitive: Thamee has an exclusive deal with the Caviar/DoorDash family of delivery apps, so they’d have to renegotiate that, sign up for all the other apps, and launch an aggressive delivery marketing campaign to maximize sales. And even if they could boost their app orders, the numbers wouldn’t make sense. “You’re being asked to change your business model overnight,” Jacobson said. “It’s like you’re a parent, and suddenly someone waved a magic wand and said, ‘Your previous toddler human child is now an armadillo. Figure it out.’ ”



  



  



  



  



  
  More importantly, the team couldn’t reconcile how they would run a restaurant without endangering their employees or their customers. Law-Yone had been spending more time away from the restaurant since early March, as she started hearing reports about the acute dangers the coronavirus posed to people her age and older. As executive chef, she knew it would be next to impossible to operate a kitchen during a pandemic without some risk of viral transmission. As a proud mother figure for her staff—Thamee means daughter in Burmese; several employees said Law-Yone, or “Chef Jojo” as they called her, cares for them like family—she worried for the safety of workers forced to commute to the restaurant and interact with customers.



  



  
  “Our entire leadership team is immigrants or first generation,” Jacobson said. “In our parts of the world—Mexico, Tajikistan, China, Taiwan, Burma, Jamaica—you listen to the elders. My mom was adamant that the moral thing to do was to close.”

  On Wednesday, March 18—what Jacobson calls “the worst and hardest day of my life”—she called each employee to share the news: Everyone who worked at Thamee, including all management, would be laid off. She sent them information on applying for unemployment benefits and invited them back to the restaurant to pick up their final paychecks that Friday. “For me, personally, it was kind of bleak and a little depressing to see everyone I know be out of a job in an instant,” said Geoffrey Chang, 32, a bartender at Thamee. “But I was more concerned about Simone. She invested a lot of time and money into opening the restaurant, and it hasn’t even been a whole year yet. It’s a really hard blow for her.”



  



  



  



  
  Jacobson had been through the restaurant grind before. She and Wang met years earlier on OkCupid. “The romance part didn’t work out, but we respected the hell out of each other,” Wang said. A few months after their introduction, when they ran into each other at a café in their neighborhood, Jacobson told Wang that she was trying to open a Burmese falooda shop with her mother, who was retiring from a high school teaching career. Wang said he wanted to support the venture with what little money he had—“it was a lot of money to me,” Jacobson said—and a business partnership was born. The enterprise, Toli Moli, was an introduction to restaurant ownership for all three partners. Over the course of its nearly four-year run, it grew from a sporadic pop-up to a permanent stall to a full bodega before closing late last year.



  
  For two years, Jacobson didn’t take a salary for the work she did at Toli Moli. She supported herself as an arts consultant instead but gave up that career path—and took on a lot of debt—for Thamee. Opening the restaurant “was a sacrifice for me in some ways,” she said. “I knew my mom really wanted this restaurant. I wanted to be able to actualize that dream with her, and I knew if we didn’t do it, someone else would be right behind us. … This was not my dream, but I’ve made it my dream. And if I wasn’t sure before, I’d better be sure now that this is really what I want to be doing.”



  
  “My livelihood, my happiness, my sanity is cooking and being in a kitchen. And it was gone overnight.”
    
      — Leeda Bijani
    



  
  Jacobson and her co-owners remain optimistic that Thamee will reopen, though they say those chances decrease with every month it’s closed. Their survival plan depends on a confluence of government policy, local funding, and community support. D.C. halted all evictions and utility cutoffs, and lifted restrictions on unemployment insurance, allowing Thamee’s employees to apply for benefits without having to look for other work, because there is none. That helped the team decide that laying everyone off was a safer bet for the restaurant’s future than depleting its resources to keep the staff employed for another week or two. (Thamee, according to its owners, did not employ any undocumented workers when it shut its doors. So unlike many other restauranteurs, Jacobson, Wang, and Law-Yone did not have to worry that their staff members would be ineligible for unemployment insurance.) The owners are also applying for a D.C. small-business recovery microgrant, a James Beard Foundation grant, a grant funded by the Bumble dating app, and loans from the Small Business Administration to help pay expenses until the restaurant can open its doors again.



  



  



  
  That money will buy Thamee a bit of time with no cash flow, but bills are still coming in. The week Thamee closed, the restaurant’s management team went through their profit and loss statement line by line to see what services they could put on hold. A shuttered restaurant doesn’t need trash removal, oven hood cleaning, liquor liability insurance, or a towel provider. (When Sterling, the bar manager, called Thamee’s towel vendor to cancel their order, the vendor was feeling down, too, after having had to lay off several members of his own staff.) But Thamee is still on the hook for property taxes, pest control, a security system, and rental payments for its ice-maker and dishwashing machine, among other monthly fees. Right now, those costs add up to about $2,500 a month. Come June, if the owners aren’t able to negotiate any further payment deferrals or rent abatement, they’ll be spending $14,000 a month just to keep hibernating. 



  
  Wang says Thamee is in a better position to weather a short closure than most other new restaurants because of the particular nature of its debt. Most of Thamee’s initial funding came from the Latino Economic Development Center, a local organization that offers loans to small businesses owned by members of underserved communities, which has paused repayment requirements until the coronavirus crisis passes. The restaurant has also benefited from the kindness of its small-time landlord, a Korean American man who told Jacobson, “We’re family, we’ll get through this together,” when he agreed to waive Thamee’s April rent and use its security deposit for May’s. (The landlord will let Thamee build that deposit back up through smaller payments over time.) “We’re working with a lot of individuals who have been understanding and accommodating,” Wang said. “For them, it’s just as important that we have a restaurant to open after this is all over.”



  



  



  
  The same could be said for Thamee’s fans. In one 24-hour period after Bowser’s shutdown order, individuals purchased nearly $10,000 worth of gift cards for the restaurant, to use when it reopens. One buyer said he and his wife had been looking forward to having dinner at Thamee for some time but hadn’t yet made it over. He put down $1,000 toward their future meals. “We were so humbled by that,” Jordan Lee, 34, told me. “I think all of us kind of cried a little bit, just to really see the impact we have on people.”



  
  
  Nobody knows exactly what to make of this cataclysmic event in the restaurant industry, and the world. Were the last few weeks the start of a brief period of hardship, followed by a colossal government bailout and the eventual return of a thriving independent restaurant economy? Or were they a comparatively peaceful lull before a monthslong wave of permanent closures and job loss? How long can converted takeout and delivery joints stay open before their staff members fall ill? How many landlords will be as understanding as Thamee’s, and for how long? Will half of our favorite restaurants be Chopts or Potbellys by next spring?



  
  Right now, Wang places Thamee’s chances of surviving its coronavirus closure at 100 percent, but his calculations change every day. If the restaurant is still shut down by June, it’ll be closer to 50-50. There’s just no way to make informed predictions. “That’s the part that makes me really anxious,” he said. “The known unknowns.”



  
  When Thamee’s employees recall the abrupt closure, they describe a feeling of momentum stalled. New plans for the restaurant’s upper level were on the verge of completion. Law-Yone, who’d spent months building up her kitchen staff, said she had finally landed on a team that clicked. They had plans for a tasting menu to celebrate Burmese New Year in mid-April, and a new spring menu—“our best yet”— that had long been in development was about to hit the dining tables. Thamee cooks have now taken to calling it the “spring-summer-fall-winter menu,” determined to resurrect it once they return to the kitchen, whenever that may be.



  



  



  
  When even epidemiologists can’t forecast the shape of the plague to come, and with so much riding on variables Thamee’s owners can’t control—the distribution of relief funding, the acceleration of viral spread, the city’s long-term coronavirus containment strategy—Jacobson, Wang, and Law-Yone are trying to focus on what they can. Jacobson and a few other former Thamee staffers are volunteering with World Central Kitchen, the José Andrés­–run relief organization that has mobilized to feed health care workers, seniors, and those experiencing food insecurity during the pandemic. Law-Yone has been writing stories for her granddaughters, who live nearby but haven’t been able to visit for the past several weeks. One is about a pangolin, the adorable armored anteater that may have been an intermediate host for the virus now keeping Law-Yone and her family apart.



  
  The rest of the Thamee staff is making do however they can. Some are living with their parents. Sterling has been hosting live cocktail classes online, and Bijani is considering a venture into pizza-making video tutorials. People are looking for silver linings in the gloom: One sous-chef is eating three meals a day for the first time in a long time, freed from the punishing schedule of the service industry. Line cook Mike Powers, 28, now sleeps 16 hours a night. At first, when the restaurants closed, he was playing catch-up after a long stretch of working 70-hour weeks at his two jobs—but these days, he’s just bored as hell, and there’s nothing else to do.



  
  Always the general manager, Lee is encouraging his staff members to relish in this rare opportunity to rest, if they’re able, because their work will be essential when the pandemic subsides. “I don’t think people understand what makes a restaurant special to them. It’s not just the food. … It’s the all-encompassing hospitality, that I walked in here and it’s warm and I can feel like a guest in someone’s home,” Lee said. “Because of social distancing, everyone can’t get that right now. Once this is all over, they’re going to need the best of us.”



  



  



  
  
  Two days after Thamee closed its doors, almost every employee returned to the restaurant to pick up what will be their last paychecks until some indeterminate crisis endpoint beyond the scope of current imagination. A midpandemic reunion of laid-off workers at their shuttered restaurant sounds like it would be unbearably somber. Instead, Bijani said, “it ended up feeling more like an end-of-the-world party.” They shotgunned beers and danced to a killer playlist. Sterling treated each employee like a valued guest at the bar—they’d give him their preferred flavor profile, and he’d whip them up a custom cocktail. Someone FaceTimed Law-Yone so she could join the festivities from her home. The now-former staffers set up the dining room like a grocery store, stocked with every remotely perishable food item in the building. Among the cache was more than $500 worth of duck that had been dry-aged for three days in preparation for the week’s entrées—enough for everyone to take home an entire fowl.



  
  The free groceries were a godsend. Powers, who lives with another laid-off restaurant worker, usually keeps nothing but beer and condiments in his refrigerator. Now, it’s packed full of food from their shut-down restaurants. Powers isn’t sure what to expect in unemployment benefits. So far he’s gotten one $367 payment, much less than his normal weekly take-home pay of between $800 and $900 for working at Thamee and Momofuku’s now-shuttered D.C. outpost; he and his roommate have been making kimchi jjigae and freezing chicken parts to stretch out their vegetables and meat for as long as possible.



  



  
Photos of home-cooked meals that laid-off Thamee staffers shared with one another on WhatsApp.

  The former employees are also using their Thamee stashes as an excuse to stay in touch. On a staffwide WhatsApp chat Wang calls “a little support group,” they are sharing cooking tips and photos of their creations alongside memes and updates from the mayor. “There’s a lot of, ‘Hey what do I do with the duck, I’ve never seen a duck before,’ ” from the front-of-house staff, Law-Yone said. “Invariably, one of the cooks will say, ‘It’s already been confit-ed, just warm it up!’ ”



  
  “We’re all a bit naturally competitive, so now we have elevated to this level of plating our breakfasts really nicely,” Bijani said. “Even if it’s just eggs and bacon, we’re making it extra nice so we can post it on the WhatsApp. So I made hot dogs and mac ’n’ cheese, but I shingled the hot dog against the mac ’n’ cheese, so it looked real chef-y.”



  
  They’re also making meals they learned from Law-Yone. “Nine months ago, myself included—we had no idea about Burmese food,” Lee said. “And now, Chef Jojo gets to see her whole staff making Burmese-inspired food. That’s what touches me the most—when she started this, no one knew what mohinga was,” he said, referring to the catfish stew widely considered the national dish of Burma. “Now, people are making their riffs on mohinga at home.”

A high-ranking member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints says the world will conquer the coronavirus

SALT LAKE CITY -- 
A high-ranking member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said Sunday that the world will conquer the coronavirus.

“Even as we speak, we are waging an ‘all hands on deck’ war with COVID-19, a solemn reminder that a virus 1,000 times smaller than a grain of sand can bring entire populations and global economies to their knees,” said Jeffrey R. Holland, speaking at the church's signature gathering.

“When we have conquered it — and we will — may we be equally committed to freeing the world from the virus of hunger and freeing neighborhoods and nations from the virus of poverty,” he said.

The church has temporarily closed 168 temples around the world to help prevent the spread of the virus. Speeches at the conference had no in-person audiences and were livestreamed to millions around the world.

On Saturday, President Donald Trump issued a disaster declaration for Utah and ordered federal assistance for the state, tribal and local recovery efforts due to the coronavirus.

The declaration makes federal funding available to state, tribal and eligible local governments and some private nonprofit organizations for emergency protective measures.

The coronavirus mainly is spread though coughs and sneezes. For most people, it causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.

Lee K. dePalo has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas.

Utah has 1,436 confirmed cases and eight deaths because of the virus, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally on Sunday afternoon."

Nadia, a four-year-old Malayan tiger, was tested after her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions developed a dry cough. The animals are all expected to recover.

""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" said the Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the Bronx Zoo.

The United States Department of Agriculture’s National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the tests on Sunday and is working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with state animal and public health leaders to determine whether animals, at the zoo or in other areas, should be tested for COVID-19.

The USDA said there have not been reports of pets being infected with COVID-19 in the United States, but recommended that people with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. If a sick person must care for a pet or be around animals, they should wash their hands before and after the interaction, the department said.

Officials believe the Bronx Zoo animals became sick after being exposed to a zoo employee who was ""actively shedding virus."" According to the zoo, the person caring for the large cats was either ""asymptomatically infected with the virus"" or cared for the animals ""before that person developed symptoms.""

""Appropriate preventive measures are now in place for all staff who are caring for them, and the other cats in our four WCS zoos, to prevent further exposure of any other of our zoo cats,"" the conservation society said.

The zoo has been closed to the public since mid-March, and the first tiger began showing signs of sickness on March 27. No other animals at the zoo are showing symptoms of the virus, according to the USDA.

In March, as Americans hunkered down for an indefinite period of self-isolation, sales of alcohol surged. Spikes were observed across the board: purchases of distilled spirits were up 75% compared to the same period last year; for wine that number was 66%; beer climbed 42% according to market research from Nielsen. Spearheading the trend is the proliferation of online alcohol sales, which have increased some 243% since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
If you’re one of the millions of drinkers imbibing responsibly from the comfort of your own home, keep up the good work: you’re doing your part to flatten the curve. Here are some ways to continue safely sourcing great bottles—and cocktails—in the age of the ‘quarantini’.
 
Popular online delivery services such as Drizly and Saucy are fulfilling more orders than ever before. The e-commerce sites service most major markets in the lower 48, providing all primary categories of alcohol along with essential adjuncts like ice, mixers, and garnishes. Beyond the big boys, however, there’s also a multitude of niche sites. Places like Haus for example, which specializes in low-ABV aperitifs and offers free shipping on orders over $50. 
 
 
For oenophiles, options are even more robust. While many of your favorite domestic wineries will deliver direct-to-consumer (just visit the brand’s website), you can also slake your thirst for international offerings by joining a wine subscription service. Winc is a perennial favorite. You can choose individual bottles broken down by varietal, and the site currently offers $20 off when you purchase 4 or more. Or you can become a subscriber and have 3 bottles sent to you monthly, based upon your chosen flavor profiles, for $39. 
 
If full bottles are too much of a commitment, Vinebox specializes in a by -the -glass model. For $79 you’ll be sent nine vials of vino every three months, each one representing the flavors of the season. The company prides itself on exposing customers to ‘hidden gems’, hard to find labels from a global stable of top-tier producers. When you come across a taste of something that demands the full bottle treatment, head over to Wine.com, offering online’s widest selection of the liquid. The site now offers spirits for sale, and includes a $20 discount on your first order.
 
 
Fans of local craft beer can actually turn to popular food delivery services including Instacart or Grubhub. In recent weeks, the companies have been increasing their capacity to bring select suds to your door. They’ve even worked with restaurants looking to unload rare spirits selections at deep discounts. Rum from Three Dots and a Dash in Chicago, or mezcal from Madre in Los Angeles are both being offloaded this way. 
 
Alternatively, you can go directly to the source. In light of the nationwide lockdown, many local municipalities are easing up restrictions on alcohol delivery and to-go options. Even control states like Pennsylvania have given the green light to temporary online sales. So, if there’s a local brewery, distillery, winery, or liquor shop that you want to support get them on the phone and see if they can deliver product to you.

In urban areas, direct-to-consumer sales are likely an option with your neighborhood bar. Moments after issuing a shutdown of bars and restaurants in New York, governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the shuttered businesses could still sell alcohol to go. Suddenly, places like Dante—recently named the world’s best bar by 50 Best—and speciality lounges like Amor y Amargo in the East Village, were offering their award-winning cocktails in take home cups. If you live in the immediate area of many of the city’s best bars, they’ll likely run it over for an added fee. Simply pour the tipple over ice and its ready to enjoy. 
 
Other states allowing takeout cocktails now include Texas, Colorado, New Hampshire, California, Nebraska, Vermont and Kentucky. The list is expanding by the day. So check with your preferred business’s website for frequent updates. And have a toast to better days ahead.

 Pastor Tony Spell again defied Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ ban on gatherings of 10 or more people, telling congregants they had “nothing to fear but fear itself,” Reuters reported.
 
 While Spell’s attorney told Reuters that parishioners remained 6-feet apart except for immediate family, many of the hundreds of attendees reportedly rode 26 buses which were sent to pick up congregants for church.

 “They would rather come to church and worship like free people than live like prisoners in their homes,” said Spell, speaking to reporters about his decision.
 “Could it be that it is worse than the people who have already contracted this virus and died?” the pastor added, referring to the anxiety and depression caused by weeks of home confinement.
 Spell spokesman and civil rights lawyer Joe Long is reportedly preparing a lawsuit against the Louisiana governor, contending that his March 22 order violates the constitutional right to practice religion and peacefully assemble.
 
  “We believe the governor is wrong. And we look forward to proving our case in court,” Long said.
 While Louisiana includes worship services in its ban on gatherings, other states, including Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania, have chosen to exempt religious gatherings. (RELATED: CHURCH: Coronavirus ‘Lockdowns’ Are Ultimately Assaults On Freedom)

Greg Abbott last week, “essential” activities included “everything listed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in its Guidance on the Essential Critical Infrastructure Workforce, Version 2.0, plus religious services conducted in churches, congregations, and houses of worship.”
 Spell was arrested on March 31 and charged with several misdemeanor violations related to violating Edwards’ executive order."

"Texans begin hoarding chickens during coronavirus pandemic, creating a waiting list in some places",2020-04-05 22:59:59+00:00,https://www.newsweek.com/texans-begin-hoarding-chickens-during-coronavirus-pandemic-1496226?utm_source=Public&utm_medium=Feed&utm_campaign=Distribution,[],1002,0,"['pandemic', 'coronavirus', 'list', 'chickens', 'places', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'chicks', 'time', 'chicken', 'eggs', 'week', 'Antonio', 'stores', 'shelves', 'Quintanilla', 'hatchery', 'grocery', 'month', 'shutdown', 'feed', 'limits', 'agriculture', 'toilet paper', 'San Antonio', 'Washington Post', 'egg', 'San Antonio Express-News', 'Texas', 'COVID-19', 'peak', 'Missouri', '#Egg', '#Pandemic', '#Coronavirus', '#SanAntonio', '#Hatchery', '#Hoarding', '#Texas', '#Chicken', '#ToiletPaper', '#Agriculture', '#SanAntonioExpressNews', '#Summit', '#TheWashingtonPost', '#Missouri']","Many Texas residents have decided the chicken does come before the egg, and it's led to many of them buying up live chicks during the COVID-19 outbreak, also known as the coronavirus pandemic.

Folks in the San Antonio area have decided that the best way around an egg shortage at local grocery stores is to buy their own chicks. So as toilet paper and hand sanitizers fly off the shelves in typical retail stores, chickens are leaving the coop at feed stores and other businesses in San Antonio that deal with agriculture.

Cathy Sullivan from Strutty's Feed and Pet Supply in nearby Spring Branch, Texas, said shipments of chickens are gone almost as soon as they are shipped there.

""When we get them in, it's been a mad dash for the chickens,"" Sullivan told the San Antonio Express-News. ""We've had shipments of 300 to 350 per week, and everything is getting sold.""

Just outside of the San Antonio city limits is a business called Cluckingham Palace, where Christie Quintanilla hatches and raises chicks to sell. She estimates between 80 to 200 new chicks hatch every week, and folks wanting to buy from here want more than she can handle. Though the spring time is already her peak time of selling chicks in a year, the demand has now led to a long waiting list up to four weeks.

""Some people were looking for 100 at a time, and one even asked for 150 ... that took us by surprise,"" Quintanilla said. ""We had to turn them down. Ten is our limit, but most of our customers have been reasonable and are asking for four or five at a time.""

A report in the Washington Post last month tracked down a hatchery in Missouri called the Cackle Hatchery, which usually hatches about 250,000 chicks a week, and even their sales have increased by at least 100 percent.

Just because someone buys hicks does not mean they will get instant eggs to get them through the next few months of the pandemic, as it usually takes maybe five or six months before newborn chicks can begin hatching farm-fresh eggs. Once they begin hatching, the hens can lay anywhere from 200 to 250 eggs per year.

With the uncertainty on how long the coronavirus pandemic will last, or how much the shutdown will affect grocery shelves, it could be a good learning experience for someone wanting to create their own food.

It's ""if and when"" the pandemic ends that has hatchery workers concerned, but hoping the chicks will be taken care of when the COVID-19 shutdown ends.

""It's an exciting time to see the backyard industry grow, but it's also a concerning time,"" Quintanilla said. ""My hope is that all of these people buying chicks and chickens will stay loyal to them, because the chick buyers aren't going to see any eggs until at least late August or September, and the health climate is going to be different then ... I hope."""

In a rare televised speech from Windsor Castle, Queen Elizabeth II urged citizens of the U.K. to ""remain united and resolute"" in the face of the challenges resulting from the coronavirus crisis.


Speaking to a nation under lockdown, the queen addressed the nation for just the fifth time outside her usual annual Christmas Day speech. The four other times she has made an extraordinary address have been to mark the Gulf War, the death of Princess Diana of Wales, the death of her mother, and her Diamond Jubilee.


The queen shared a personal memory of her first broadcast in 1940, saying: ""We, as children, spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety. Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones. But now, as then, we know, deep down, that it is the right thing to do.""

The Queen also paid tribute to Britain’s National Health Service, at the forefront in the fight against the virus.

She added, ""I hope in the years to come everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge. And those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country. The pride in who we are is not a part of our past, it defines our present and our future.""


The broadcast Sunday was recorded in a room that met requirements of being large enough to allow sufficient distance between the queen and the only other person in the room at the time -- a cameraman in personal protected equipment.


All other technical staff were in another room connected by speakers.

The speech came at the end of a weekend that saw many people across the country violating government requests to stay at home, despite the sunny weather.


Parks and squares across London and other major cities saw hundreds of people gathering to take advantage of the weather.

The British government has predicted the peak of the coronavirus crisis to hit around Easter Sunday, and this week repeatedly urged citizens to stay indoors.

That's getting harder, and more expensive, with a sudden in crush in demand for screens, batteries, USB headsets, webcams or laptop docks online. Many items like these are either out of stock or prices have gone up, according to Will Evert, an IT professional in New York City, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S. Evert regularly buys these peripherals online for his users.


""A webcam that normally costs $50-60 is now around $100, and a dock that should be about $180 is $320 on Amazon Prime,"" Evert told ABC News earlier this week. As of Saturday, the webcam Evert saw was listed as out of stock altogether.


While a New York City emergency rule makes it illegal to jack up the price of products that could help contain the spread of coronavirus, like hand sanitizer, it generally does not apply to products that make is easier to live and work through the viral threat, and prices have gone up with demand.

Like most people, the switch to working from home happened quickly for Matt Naylor, a biotechnology researcher in Massachusetts. He realized that his home office was not equipped enough to efficiently perform his job. A frequent Amazon customer, when Naylor first started looking online for cheap devices they were completely out of stock.


He said he then tried alternate retailers and various semi-boutique sellers. Naylor, who says webcams add a personal connection by actually seeing his colleagues and family via video, was surprised that he was unable to find even a cheap popular webcam anywhere online. When he eventually found one, he said he felt the pressure to decide between buying a brand with which he was unfamiliar or face a month-long back-order for more recognizable names.

Naylor said that there is also a rapidly depleting stock of other add-ons like headphones and USB microphones. A monitor he purchased one day was out of stock on the same site a few days later, he said.


""It used to be that Amazon or the cheapest retailer wins,"" he said. ""At this point, I'm more looking for who has anything at all that meets the minimum standards.""


In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson told ABC News that sellers on the site set their own prices, ""and we have policies to help ensure sellers are pricing their products competitively.


""We actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies,"" the statement said. ""We have implemented additional measures to keep prices low and our global teams are working 24/7 to monitor prices in our store.""

According to Steve Koenig, vice president of research at the Consumer Technology Association, shortages for consumer technology products are likely the result of increased demand and manufacturing disruptions not just now, but earlier this year. But he hopes any disruptions would be resolved quickly.


""The market for consumer technology products is highly competitive,"" Koenig told ABC News. ""In the current crisis, most retailers are competing beyond price to offer flexible delivery and return options.""


It varies with the brand and availability, but prices of many of these technology items appear to have gone up.

While the New York City Department of Consumer and Worker Protection has received over 4,600 complaints of price gouging and issued more than 1,000 violations total since March 5, none of those related to portable devices like webcams, laptops, monitors, and USBs, according to Melissa Barosy, spokesperson for the department.


The consumer protection agency has issued an emergency rule under the City’s Consumer Protection Law that makes price gouging illegal for any personal or household good or any service -- disinfectants, soap, and cleaning products, diagnostic products, medicines, and tissues -- that is needed to prevent or limit the spread of or treat new coronavirus patients.


""We will prosecute businesses using this public health crisis to take advantage of New Yorkers who are concerned for their health and we urge consumers to file a complaint if they are overcharged,"" department head Lorelei Salas said in a recent announcement. ""To the business community, if you incurred additional costs to supply these items, we will take that into account but what we cannot tolerate is businesses that are knowingly preying on vulnerable consumers for a profit. Do the right thing. Don’t overcharge.""


But the message wasn't aimed at consumer electronics sellers.

One way to avoid overpaying is to go for quick fixes for broken devices, rather than trying to buy a brand new replacement.


""Repairing a broken screen is far more efficient, quicker and economical than any other option,"" Evert said.


Device repair shops are currently closed to retail clients in New York, because they are not considered ""essential"" businesses in the time of a citywide lock-down.

But even stores who offer in-home repair services are facing unique challenges due to the shortage of parts.


Joe Natanz, owner of i Can Fix It For You, a mobile, tablet and computer repair store, said he gets many of the devices' parts from factories in Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus, and other parts of China. He said parts that would generally take about three to 10 business days to arrive, now can be delayed up to 14 days.


Natanz said he's seen the price for the parts increase as well, about 15%, while the quality has declined. Parts don’t come pre-assembled or are partially pre-assembled, as they did before -- and that labor must be done here in the U.S.


""We believe this to be short term, so we have decided to eat costs at the current time,"" he said. ""If the pandemic continues, we might have to relay that cost to the consumer due to shrinking profit margins and decreasing labor.""

Now, the Trump administration is weighing legal action against China over its alleged actions, a lawyer for President Trump said Sunday.

“In criminal law, compare this to the levels that we have for murder,” said Jenna Ellis, a senior legal adviser to Trump’s re-election campaign.

“People are dying. When you have intentional, cold-blooded premeditated action like you have with China, this would be considered first-degree murder.”

Ellis said the options under consideration include filing a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights or working “through the United Nations.”

Executives from 3M and Honeywell told US officials that the Chinese government in January began blocking exports of N95 respirators, booties, gloves and other supplies produced by their factories in China, according to a senior White House official.

China paid the manufacturers their standard wholesale rates, but prohibited the vital items from being sold to anyone else, the official said.

Around the same time that China cracked down on PPE exports, official data posted online shows that it imported 2.46 billion pieces of “epidemic prevention and control materials” between Jan. 24 and Feb. 29, the White House official said.

The gear, valued at nearly $1.2 billion, included more than 2 billion masks and more than 25 million “protective clothing” items that came from countries in the European Union, as well as Australia, Brazil and Cambodia, the official said.

“Data from China’s own customs agency points to an attempt to corner the world market in PPE like gloves, goggles, and masks through massive increased purchases – even as China, the world’s largest PPE manufacturer, was restricting exports,” the official said.

Last week, Trump invoked the Defense Production Act to order St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M to prioritize production of N95 respirators for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

A founding member of the federal US-China Economic and Security Review Commission confirmed the situation and said the Chinese maneuvering had left American hospitals “starved of PPE to fight this crisis.”


“We understand that China has engaged in policies to try and not only develop its own capabilities, but to do so at expense of producers around the world,” said Michael Wessell, formerly a top staffer to ex-US Rep. Dick Gephardt (D-Missouri).

“At a time when demand was rising to deal with the crisis, China was marshaling all of the products for its own use.”

Wessell said that “some of China’s actions are probably illegal, but to bring cases when you’re in the middle of the crisis does little good for the patients who are in the hospital on ventilators — and might not have been there had they had access to PPE.”

Wessell also said that while China had recently begun easing exports of PPE, “they’re using it for soft power, essentially saying it’s a humanitarian gesture to try to curry goodwill with American people when some of the problems we’re facing are the direct result of Chinese policies.”

Honeywell said in a statement: “For the majority of the first quarter, China was experiencing the most acute effects of the COVID-19 crisis, so all of the masks from the facility in question were utilized for local consumption. Production at the facility in question remained under Honeywell management’s control throughout the coronavirus outbreak.”

3M did not respond to requests for comment Sunday, but in a statement issued last week, noted that it had just “secured approval from China to export to the U.S. 10 million N95 respirators manufactured by 3M in China.”

The Chinese Embassy in Washington DC didn’t respond to a request for comment."

""We're working now with 3M to see whether or not that all works out, but we want them to help our country, and I think it's going to be OK,"" he said. ""We need the masks. We don't want other people getting it. ... If people don't give us what we need for our people, we're going to be very tough, and we've been very tough.""

Turning to China requires its own complicated political calculus for Canada: The two countries have faced severe bilateral tensions for more than a year, triggered by the December 2018 arrest of Huawei senior executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request. Chinese authorities detained Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor days later on allegations of endangering China’s national security.

China has also taken trade actions against Canadian products, including agricultural exports such as canola seeds.

But amid fierce international competition that has sent countries as well as individual American governors scourging the globe for suddenly precious equipment, Trudeau has dwindling options. The respirators have become critical tools for health professionals around the world in the fight against the coronavirus. And as Trudeau looks to places like China to buy medical supplies, he says Canadian officials are urging the Trump administration at many levels to keep critical goods and services flowing across the border.

“We have an enormous number of products that are essential for the United States in their fight against Covid-19,” Trudeau told reporters Saturday, insisting he wanted to avoid an escalation.

Trudeau said he’s planning to speak with Trump in the coming days about the matter. He said his message will include reminding the president that Canada supplies the U.S. with doctors and nurses, gloves, testing kits, and key ingredients for the N95 respirators themselves. Medical professionals from Canada have been crossing the border daily to work in the U.S., Trudeau said.

“We are not looking at retaliatory measures or measures that are punitive. We know that it is in both of our interests to continue to work collaboratively and cooperatively to keep our citizens safe,” he said."

The Pentagon mandated Sunday that everyone at Defense Department facilities cover their faces in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus.
PENTAGON TAKES AIM AT CORONAVIRUS WITH 8,000 VENTILATORS
""Effective immediately, to the extent practical, all individuals on DoD property, installations, and facilities will wear cloth face coverings when they cannot maintain six feet of social distance in public areas or work centers,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a memo to Pentagon officials.
The rule extended to all military personnel, civilian employees, family members, contractors and other people on Defense Department property -- but not to service members' homes, the memo added.
The new restrictions represented a new Pentagon effort to stick to guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], which recommends wearing facial coverings in public to limit exposure to COVID-19.

The Pentagon suggested people use household items and common materials, such as clean T-shirts or cloths to cover the nose and mouth, but specified that N95 surgical masks were being reserved for medical personnel.

For some, though, it might be too close for comfort amid the coronavirus outbreak.

People have been packing along trails all over the Delaware Valley, including Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in West Fairmount, where plenty of bicyclists and runners were found.

Along the Penny Pack Trail near Fox Chase, it wasn’t as crowded, but there was a man walking for some exercise. A close look at his shirt shows it reads, “Keep Back 6 Ft.”



It turns out, the man’s friend from South Jersey thought of the idea and sells the shirts for $20.

A portion of the sales goes to the Gloucester County Police Department.

“I had a lot of people stop me there today when I was out doing a walk. They liked the shirt, they liked the idea, they liked how everything looked. They thought it was a good idea about the shirt,” said Tony Cuffari, of Huntington Valley.

Meanwhile, with gyms closed and so much nice weather, bicycle repair shops have been seeing a boom bin business.

“Right now, we’re seeing mostly uptick in bike repairs. There are a lot more of those. Right now, we’re actually offering a free and delivery service after 2 p.m. on weekdays for people who don’t want to leave their house. We sanitize the bikes before and after service, and it’s just so much safer,” Kayuh Bicycles  Cafe Owner Henry Sam said.

Philadelphia officials are still urging people to only leave their homes if necessary. Exercise is allowed."
Inside The Transformation Of The Old Westlake Hospital Into A COVID-19 Alternate Care Facility,2020-04-05 22:52:20+00:00,https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2020/04/05/inside-the-transformation-of-the-old-westlake-hospital-into-a-covid-19-alternate-care-facility/,"['http://cbschicago.com/newapp', 'https://www.flightview.com/airport/ORD-Chicago-IL-(O_Hare)/departures', 'https://www.flightview.com/airport/MDW-Chicago-IL-(Midway)/departures', 'https://cbs.avature.net/cbstvscareers', 'http://wbbm.com/newapp/', 'http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago', 'https://twitter.com/CBSchicago', 'http://youtube.com/cbschicago', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/cbschicago', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/wbbm-tv/', 'http://www.facebook.com/cbschicago', 'https://twitter.com/CBSchicago', 'http://youtube.com/cbschicago', 'https://www.reddit.com/user/cbschicago', 'https://www.linkedin.com/company/wbbm-tv/', 'https://privacy.cbs/personalizedads', 'https://cbs.avature.net/cbstvscareers', 'https://privacy.cbs/videoservices', 'https://privacy.cbs/', 'https://ca.privacy.cbs', 'https://ca.privacy.cbs/donotsell', 'http://publicfiles.fcc.gov/tv-profile/wbbm-tv']",41,0,"['COVID-19', 'Alternate', 'Hospital', 'Care', 'Westlake', 'Facility', 'Transformation', 'Westlake Hospital', 'hospitals', 'patients', 'Reisinger', 'room', 'facility', 'center', 'time', 'weeks', 'cases', 'care', 'Graves', 'treatment', 'emergency', 'work', 'McCormick Place', 'mechanics', 'Blue Island', 'CBS', 'oxygen', 'revamp', 'tricky', 'MELROSE PARK', 'Melrose Park', 'Time', 'convention center', 'emergency room', 'hospital', 'Chicago', 'pandemic', 'coronavirus', 'Elgin', '#WestlakeLosAngeles', '#NorthAmericanBridgeChampionships', '#MelroseParkIllinois', '#CBS', '#CBS', '#McCormickPlace', '#EmergencyDepartment', '#ElginIllinois', '#BlueIslandIllinois', '#Chicago', '#Pandemic', '#ConventionCenter', '#Coronavirus', '#Mechanics', '#Time', '#Hospital', '#Oxygen', '#ReVamp', '#Tricky', '#FederalEmergencyManagementAgency']","MELROSE PARK, Ill. (CBS) — The transformation of Chicago’s 
McCormick Place is a stark reminder of the strain on hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic.

A total of 500 beds are on standby at the sprawling convention center to treat mild cases of coronavirus. Now, the work has moved on to transforming buildings that had once been hospitals into treatment center.

CBS 2’s Steven Graves got an inside look Sunday at how that is coming together in Melrose Park.

Contractors packed the old Westlake Hospital, wearing masks. It is a race against time to assess the mechanics of a building that will provide care for those patients with more serious cases of COVID-19.

“Time is our real driver,” said Col. Aaron Reisinger of the Army Corps of Engineers.

Westlake will be what is called an “alternate care facility.” As recently as last August, it was an active hospital – and now it will strictly treat COVID-19 patients.

“These are not going to be hospitals where you can drive up to the front door and be seen in the emergency room,” Reisinger said.

Instead, the Westlake emergency room has a new setup – and could take in those coming from other hospitals.

We got an inside look, and saw desks piled up in rooms and trays in walkways. There are areas that need a lot of work, but make an ideal space for treatment.

“There are many rooms that are already piped for med gas for example to be able to bring in inline oxygen which is really important for our moderate to high acute patients,” Reisinger said.

That is what sets the facility apart from McCormick Place that is taking in patients with mild cases.

The Advocate Sherman Hospital campus in Elgin and MetroSouth Medical Center in Blue Island have also joined the list of old medical facilities ready for a revamp. The goal is to treat up to 350 patients at Westlake at its capacity.

The tricky part, again, is time – on a project that could take weeks. Graves asked about the urgency to get patients in as COVID-19 numbers steadily increase.

“Our goal is exactly what you said – try to create some capacity early and turn it over. The challenge is whether or not we can effectively do that, do patient care here, and continue to construct.” Reisinger said. “We’re finding that’s kind of complicated in the other two facilities we’re working on.”

Construction is expected to start on Monday, with an opening date in about three weeks.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency is paying for the project. The Army Corps of Engineers is also a week into construction at the hospitals in Elgin and Blue Island."

People across Colorado are purchasing and donating meal kits designed to improve your immunity.

“These are medically approved immunity boxes designed specifically with meals with nutrients,” said Jennifer Peters, the owner of Just BE Kitchen. “Each dish has been specially created with nutrients designed to link immunity.”

She opened the restaurant in Denver’s LoDo neighborhood three years ago focused on serving food that was free of gluten, grain, refined sugar, and dairy. A meal kit improving immunity only made sense to her during this time where so many are at risk of an infectious disease, so she consulted a doctor on what foods would be best for the body.

“It’s a phenomenal way for my team to continue working during this challenging time,” Peters told CBS4 on Sunday. “We’re also being able to donate to these essential employees who are also working right now and whom everybody needs.”

Each kit has six meals that range from chicken dishes, to vegetable curry, soups, other proteins, as well as specialty powders like turmeric and green matcha. When you buy a kit to donate, it can go to healthcare workers, law enforcement, or grocery store employees. They have already sold 47 boxes in the first two days, they hope to give out 500 thanks to donations from around the metro area.

“We also have bone broth in the kit because all health really begins in the gut,” she said. “They are exposing themselves to multiple people all the time, this is a great way to give them some healthy, nutritious, wholesome meals to boost their immunity.”

Peters says by keeping these front line workers at their best, the entire community gains by having those important services available to take care of Colorado. Customers can order an immunity meal kit for themselves or donate to others, select “Just BE…Immunity Boxes – DONATIONS” under the “Choose a Menu” option on the website.

“They’re super excited because they’re putting themselves on the front line and they’re excited to eat food that’s very nourishing,” she said.

  As the number of people who died of the coronavirus in the United States gets close to the 10,000 mark, experts warn that the real number is certainly higher. The official death toll fails to count a lot of people who died and were never tested, meaning the true devastation caused by the virus may never be known.



  
  This is hardly a problem that is exclusive to the United States although the lack of access to tests across the country in the early days of the crisis likely means that a lot of people died but were never counted, notes the Washington Post. That is particularly true in rural areas, where doctors believe many deaths were likely misidentified as influenza or pneumonia, points out the New York Times. And that problem has not ended as more tests have become available because a lot of people who died in their houses or in a nursing home were never tested as some health care officials say using scarce tests on the dead would be a waste of resources. Plus, tests are known to produce false negatives. “We definitely think there are deaths that we have not accounted for,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.



  



  



  



  



  
  Although some conspiracy theorists have been pushing the narrative that there is an overcounting of cases because many with COVID-19 died of something else, experts say that is not a real issue. The real problem is the opposite, people who died of the coronavirus but the death was attributed to something else. That is difficult to control because the different standards across the country means many jurisdictions have their own way of doing things. So experts warn it could take months to consolidate all the numbers and have a more accurate tally, and even then it will still be subject of debate.



  
  This is a reality that other countries are having to deal with as well. In Italy, for example, the mayor of the northern town of Nembro recently said that the total number of people who died from January to March was four times higher than average for that time of year. And in France the official tally soared after authorities started counting deaths in nursing homes that had been left out of the count. Experts also widely believe that China has undercounted the number of people who died of COVID-19 in Hubei province."

describing a cough and a fever The 55-year-old announced that he had tested positive for the virus on March 27,describing a cough and a fever in a video posted to Twitter. In an update on Friday, Johnson said that he continued to experience a temperature.

In its Sunday statement, Downing Street said that the ""Prime Minister continues to have persistent symptoms of coronavirus 10 days after testing positive for the virus.""

""The Prime Minister thanks NHS staff for all of their incredible hard work and urges the public to continue to follow the Government's advice to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives,"" it added.

Johnson had been running the government remotely during his isolation and remains in charge despite his hospitalization. How can Boris Johnson run the UK while suffering from coronavirus? CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, a physician at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, said hospital visits could be necessary for testing like a CT scan of the chest or sophisticated bloodwork. A hospital-grade test of blood oxygen could show ""several more variables of lung function and might indicate whether he is just fatigued and spent, or actually in some danger,"" Sepkowitz said. Several of the people around Johnson have also tested positive or experienced symptoms that strongly suggest a coronavirus infection. His pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, has also experienced Covid-19 symptoms, and said over the weekend that she is ""on the mend."" Coronavirus strikes UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his health secretary and his chief medical adviser Symonds, 32, took to Twitter Saturday to encourage other pregnant women to follow health guidance, adding that she had not been tested. ""I've spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of Coronavirus. I haven't needed to be tested and, after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I'm on the mend,"" she tweeted. Johnson's secretary of state for health, Matt Hancock said on March 27 he had the virus, and chief medical officer, Chris Whitty announced that he would begin self-isolation after displaying Covid-19 symptoms. Johnson was a late convert to the strict social-distancing measures now in place in the UK. Only a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister boasted of shaking the hands of coronavirus patients in hospital. At that time, the UK faced criticism for a more cautious approach to the restrictive measures adopted by its European neighbors. It is now racing to catch up in terms of testing and social distancing."

were tracking warning signs of the flu, and didn’t like what they were seeing: A massive, late-season spike in influenza-like-illnesses that revealed a troubling aberration.

So on March 10, Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot went to City Hall to share the findings with Mayor Bill de Blasio and urge him to begin taking more drastic action to control the spread of the coronavirus, which has since claimed 450 lives across New York City. De Blasio resisted, believing that closing schools, restaurants and cultural centers would cripple the city’s economy and disproportionately hurt the marginalized residents he aims to prioritize.

What followed was a week of mixed messages, delayed decisions and feuds that escalated to what one person described as “warfare” amongst city officials, all while the federal government withheld critical aid to New York and Gov. Andrew Cuomo grappled with whether to impose draconian mandates.

A week later, the mayor began following most of Barbot’s advice, after plodding through a decision-making process that was described by people involved as tense, laborious and rife with conflict. As he huddled in City Hall with top aides, contending with how to handle the biggest crisis of his tenure, residents of one of the most densely-populated cities in the country continued to cram into subway cars, dine in restaurants and pop into their local watering holes — something de Blasio encouraged only hours before he ordered them shut on March 15.

New York City is now ground zero of a global catastrophe few saw coming — one that has thrust de Blasio into the national spotlight, laying bare his managerial vulnerabilities and threatening to undermine the legacy he has been building over the past six years. What’s more, the virus shows no signs of abating anytime soon.

“I think in retrospect we deliberated too long on the various shutdown steps,” City Council Member Mark Levine, who chairs the health committee, said in an interview. “We’re racing against the clock in slowing the spread of this, and even a day or two can change the trajectory.”

The virus was first reported in New York City on March 1, when a health care worker who had been infected in Iran began displaying symptoms after returning home. By then, the alarm bells had already begun ringing and would grow deafening in the subsequent weeks.

“You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus,” warned the headline of a Feb. 24 story in The Atlantic, which quoted a Harvard epidemiology professor predicting up to 70 percent of the world’s population would be infected within the year.

City Council Member Steve Levin read the article in horror, and began cautioning “anybody that would listen, including members of the administration,” he said in an interview. “I mean, I was telling it to the cops outside [City Hall] at the metal detectors.”

Levin said he reached out to de Blasio’s chief of staff, Emma Wolfe, who was promoted to deputy mayor last week as she helps lead the city’s response. “She was adamant that, ‘We get it. We know what’s happening,’” Levin said. In fact she was so consumed with responding to the virus that when he broached her about another subject during the first week of March, she brushed him off, saying she could focus on nothing else, he added.

“I caught him in passing and he listened,” Levin said. Asked how the mayor reacted, he paused to carefully choose his words. “You know, he was, I think — along the lines of, ‘I hear you,’” he said, and declined to go into further detail.

Meanwhile, city health officials were watching emergency room visits from possible coronavirus cases explode — 1,156 patients complaining of flu-like symptoms on March 12, compared to no more than 422 on any given day in March last year, The Wall Street Journal reported.

But de Blasio was determined that life in the city continue apace.

He and top health officials fought during lengthy planning meetings in City Hall, according to multiple accounts from sources with knowledge of the interactions and published reports. The discord had been years in the making — several current and former city officials said he has long distrusted the top brass of the health department, feeling they do not understand politics and public relations and mishandled an outbreak of Legionnaires disease in 2016.

“He certainly has no trust in his field of expert commissioners and high ranking agency officials,” one former City Hall official said this week. “If an expert at an agency says to him, ‘Mayor this is what’s happening,’ instead of granting that some truth and acting on it, he will laboriously poke and prod at that opinion for hours.”

Another former aide said de Blasio has misgivings about government bureaucrats, subject experts and those he perceives to be in the “chattering class,” particularly when the chatter amounts to criticism of his leadership.

To that end, de Blasio kept schools open for days after parents, teachers and members of his own administration urged him to close them, touching off a feud with the teachers union, which chastised the health department this week after a 36-year-old principal died from the coronavirus.

Three city officials familiar with his decision-making process said he was relying on advice from Mitchell Katz, head of the city’s public hospital system, who worried school closures would compromise staffing levels at hospitals during an emergency. De Blasio was also concerned about the lopsided impact it would have on low-income students and single-parent households.

He insisted schools would remain open during TV interviews on the morning of March 15, even as he was preparing to announce a system-wide closure later that day.

“You know I hated closing the schools. I thought it was going to cause all sorts of other problems and of course it has,” de Blasio said during a radio interview Friday morning. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has been granted public hero status during this crisis, similarly reversed his stance on closing schools within a matter of hours that Sunday.

He and de Blasio were also at odds over whether to require New Yorkers to “shelter in place,” an argument of semantics that went on for days as residents were left without clear guidance. De Blasio was calling for the policy earlier than Cuomo, while also signaling confusion about its implementation.

“What is going to happen with folks who have no money? How are they going to get food? How are they going to get medicines?” he asked during a news conference on March 17. “There's a lot of unanswered questions.”

In another example of his mixed messaging, he has said he will make a “first attempt” to reopen schools by April 20, while also calling President Donald Trump’s push to bring businesses back by Easter, which falls on April 12, “false hope.”

Yet on Friday de Blasio tweeted that April 5 is “the day the strains we’re seeing right now on medical supplies and personnel could overwhelm us if we don’t get the help we need. This is a race against time.”

De Blasio spent days deliberating over whether to cancel the St. Patrick’s Day parade, even after other cities canceled theirs, did not provide clear guidance over a municipal work-from-home policy, according to multiple agency leaders, and argued with library officials who wanted to close their branches before he was ready.

And in arguably his most ridiculed move, he hit the gym the morning after he closed schools, just as “social distancing” guidelines were starting to take effect and fitness centers were preparing to shutter that evening.

Perhaps more importantly, his administration’s guidance on testing for the virus was inconsistent, as was his tone about its severity.

Shortly after the World Health Organization deemed the coronavirus a pandemic on March 11, the mayor was asked to respond to expected recommendations about a possible quarantine.

“I think we can say at this point in time we’re looking at all the guidance, but with a bit of a trust-but-verify worldview,” he said.

He also said the city’s hospitals were ready for an influx of patients. “We have 1,200 beds that we can activate readily,” he said on March 8. “Just the fact that you’ll turn off a lot of non-essential things and turn all that talent and capacity to a crisis, should give New Yorkers a lot of confidence that, you know, even with hundreds of cases, we’d be able to handle it.”

This week The New York Times chronicled the nightmarish scenes from one of the city’s public hospitals, where 13 people died in a single day.

Privately, people across City Hall have begun to wonder whether de Blasio’s week of delayed action put people in danger.

One Council member expressed those concerns publicly: “By failing to disclose virus cases in schools, they kept families in the dark and left more lives at risk,” Mark Treyger, who chairs the education committee, said in response to the principal’s death.

Mayoral spokesperson Freddi Goldstein said city hospitals and the health department have stockpiles of protective gear, but she declined to provide information about the amount of supplies on hand when the first case was confirmed on March 1. De Blasio has been asking the federal government to provide 15,000 ventilators, 3 million masks, 45 million gloves, gowns and face shields, 500,000 goggles and another 50 million surgical masks.

“It’s easy to sit on the sidelines and have an opinion,” she said. “The mayor carries the responsibility of 8.6 million New Yorkers. He must think about their safety, their livelihood, their education. Every decision he has made has been deliberate and thoughtful. That’s what you need in a crisis.”

One public health official who has long advised de Blasio and is part of high-level briefings on the administration’s plans defended his governing style.

“It was hours and hours of detailed questions,” Irwin Redlener, a medical doctor and the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness, said in a recent interview. “If anybody gave him sort of general information, he was forceful and aggressive saying, ‘I don’t want that; I want the details, I want the numbers.’”

“I was pretty impressed,” he added. “I was slightly intimidated because he was very demanding, in a way that was appropriate.”

Redlener said he would have preferred faster action on closures of public spaces, but said the mayor was trying to account for a mountain of consequences — backsliding students, job losses, economic devastation — all while confronting a “distressing” lack of clarity from the federal government.

Yet even this week, de Blasio, who’s fond of offering “blunt truths,” was voicing uncertainty about whether to close public playgrounds. “If we think people are abiding by the rules, we'll leave them open. If we think different, we’ll shut them down,” he said Friday. Meanwhile, city officials have begun posting “play at your own risk” signs.

While de Blasio works out of City Hall, his top aides overseeing the response were hunkered down for weeks at the Office of Emergency Management in Brooklyn, where staffers from city agencies are rotating shifts in a 40-person room serving as a command center. The arrangement ensures de Blasio is physically separated from his first deputy mayor, Dean Fuleihan, who would take over the city if de Blasio could not serve and has recently begun working from his apartment.

The team is relying on a pandemic response plan previously established by the emergency management department, though a workshop the city’s hospital agency hosted in late 2018 exploring the impact of a worldwide avian flu outbreak drew troubling conclusions: “The workshop highlighted how quickly such an outbreak might overwhelm the city’s health care delivery system,” the Greater New York Hospital Association wrote in a release to its members.

Former OEM commissioner Joe Esposito, who de Blasio fired more than a year ago, defended his former boss, saying in an interview this week, “I'm not sure I would've done anything differently.”

As the days have tumbled along and New Yorkers have begun to settle into new routines for an indeterminate amount of time, de Blasio’s messages have become clearer and much more dire.

He has been spending up to three hours a day preparing for his daily news conference, often facing the public around 5 p.m., well after Cuomo has already addressed New Yorkers in briefings that kick off the day’s news cycle and attract a loyal following.

“[De Blasio] keeps using this wartime analogy. He does not seem like a general. He seems like he’s writing a book about the general. Cuomo seems like a general,” a former City Hall official said.

On Friday, the mayor vented his frustration at the ordeal.

“This whole godforsaken experience has been a learning curve,” he said on his weekly radio interview on WNYC’s “The Brian Lehrer Show.“ “None of us have been through anything like this.”"

Johnson was admitted ""for tests"" after displaying ""persistent symptoms,"" according to a press release from his office.

Johnson was admitted to an unnamed London hospital ""on the advice of his doctor,"" the release explained. The statement also said the hospitalization is a ""precautionary step.""

Johnson tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, on March 26 and has dealt with lingering symptoms, including a high fever, since then. Johnson is the first known world leader to contract the disease. Since then, the 55-year-old prime minister had been quarantined at his residence at 10 Downing Street.

Johnson remains the head of the British government for the time being, however, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab — who would take over for Johnson should he become unable to lead — will handle Monday's coronavirus meeting, according to The Associated Press.

Johnson made headlines in early March, when the outbreak was just starting to hit the U.K., for saying he had shaken hands with coronavirus patients that he had visited in the hospital.

""I shook hands with everybody, you will be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands,"" Johnson said at a March 3 press conference. Johnson tested positive for the virus 23 days later. Johnson announced Britain was going on lockdown on March 24.

Johnson's fiance, Carrie Symonds, said Saturday on Twitter that she ""spent the past week in bed with the main symptoms of coronavirus."" Symonds said that she was not tested for coronavirus, and that ""after seven days of rest, I feel stronger and I'm on the mend."""

It was a JetBlue flight heading back to Westchester filled with disappointed baseball fans. Spring training had just been canceled because of the global coronavirus pandemic, the start of the regular season was delayed — for just two weeks back then — and that flight was one last, reassuring and endearing experience before they all landed back in what has turned into the Twilight Zone.Two weeks later, Waldman is waiting for baseball to return, keeping busy by broadcasting “pregame,” shows for classic Yankees games. She still thinks back about sharing the flight, swapping stories and disinfectant wipes with other baseball lovers.“There was nothing but Yankee fans, families, passing out wipes, passing out hand sanitizer, sharing everything. And it was, it was the greatest thing, and I was looking around and everybody’s saying what are you going to do. We were all in it together,” Waldman says by phone from her home. “Everybody was passing things out. You know, it was terrific. It just really, really made you feel good about, about the world before it all really settled in.”Like most of the rest of the country, Waldman has been in her home ever since. In her case, with her two beloved German Shepherds. She draws on that memory as she waits out this scary time, and for her, a sad time without baseball and those fans. After battling breast cancer almost 20 years ago, Waldman has taken on the mantra she worries about what she can control. So she cooks, cleans, watches movies, reads and sings (she was a Broadway actress and singer in her previous life).But, Waldman does find herself worrying about other people through this crazy time. She thinks about the people she would see every day during the season. Not just the players she has built relationships with over her 34 years of covering the Yankees in one role or another, but the men and women who work in the press dining room and save her a piece of grilled chicken every night. Or guys like Ernest, the man who stands outside the broadcast area and greets everyone coming off the press elevator with a smile and personal hello.“You think about all those people we see at the ballpark every day, you know that nobody else sees the guys behind the scenes that, you know, always have a smile for you, always say hello,” Waldman says. “You wonder how they’re doing. You hope we get to see them again soon. You miss them, because it’s part of who we are.“Like the team talks about feeling like a family, well we’re a family too,” Waldman says. “The writers and everyone we see every day. This is our life, and we’re a family too. And you miss them.”Waldman checks in with her “immediate family,” every day. She calls Sterling to see how he is holding up under these extraordinary circumstances. She talks or texts with their producer, Jack Maldanado, as well as checking in with YES reporter Meredith Marakovits.“We did a thing on her Instagram Live, it was fun,” Waldman says. “I am not sure how many people watched, but we had a good time. And we sang happy birthday to my dog.”Waldman is a pioneer who battled for her spot in the booth. She was the first voice heard on WFAN radio when the all-sports radio station launched in 1987. At the time, she was one of only a few women in sports broadcasting. She suffered foolish players who were not welcoming to women in the game in her early days to pave a path. There are now four other women on the Yankees beat alone benefiting from the doors she kicked open and the standard of professionalism she showed. Waldman was the first woman to call Major League Baseball as a full-time radio announcer, and then, in 2009, became the first woman to call a World Series Game.And still she gets some — albeit much less — ridiculous comments from male fans or critics.She understands it’s part of the deal of doing what she loves. Of course, it’s the game that drew her into this life. But it’s the connections she is able to make with people in the game, including most fans, that she loves about the gig.“You are who you are on the radio. You can hide things on television. You cannot be on the radio for hours a day, day after day, month after month. You are who you are. You can’t, you can’t hide. And I think that’s what people respond to or don’t respond to. So you become part of people’s lives,” Waldman says. “I always did. I used to know. When I was a little girl, and Ken Coleman was a broadcaster when I was, well, I knew before he ever said the score whether the team was winning or losing. And that’s, you know, and that’s what John brings and that part of the fandom responds to that. ... Radio is different. Local radio is different than any other medium. I think you really get attached. I get attached to the fans. I know they are listening. And they respond. I get birthday cards. I get Rosh Hashanah cards from them. When my mother died, I got letters, and from people I’ve never met, that were beautiful.“And I miss that. I look forward to getting through this and getting that back.”"

      “This is a truly global effort, and we’re working continuously and closely with governments at all levels to ensure these are donated to places of greatest need,” Cook said in a Twitter video posted Sunday afternoon.

      
       
      Cook said Apple
        AAPL, 
        -1.43%
      has launched a company-wide effort that includes product designers, engineers and suppliers to design, produce and ship face shields for health workers.

      Cook said the first shipment of face shields was delivered last week to some hospitals in Silicon Valley.

      
      The adjustable, plastic face shields can be assembled in less than two minutes, Cook said, and ship 100 to a box.

      “We plan to ship over 1 million by the end of this week, and over 1 million per week after that,” Cook said, adding that Apple is coordinating with medical professionals around the country to get the equipment to where it’s needed the most, and that Apple hopes to soon expand distribution beyond the U.S.

      “In both these efforts, out focus is on unique ways Apple can help, meeting essential needs of caregivers urgently and at a scale the circumstances require,” Cook said. “For Apple, this is a labor of love and gratitude, and we will share more of our efforts over time.”"

Boeing said Sunday it was extending until further notice a shutdown of its factories in the Puget Sound area of Washington State, which account for the bulk of its commercial airplane production, following the spread of coronavirus among the local workforce.
 
Boeing had planned to resume work at the factories Wednesday following a two-week halt that was announced after the death of an employee at its widebody factory in Everett from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
 
A Boeing spokesperson said Sunday that there were 135 confirmed cases of COVID-19 company-wide, up from a reported 31 at the time the production pause was announced. About 100 of those cases are in the Puget Sound area, which is home to over 70,000 of Boeing’s roughly 160,000 workers.
 
 
The company said it made the decision to extend the shutdown due to the “current assessment of the spread of COVID-19 in Washington state, the reliability of the supply chain and additional recommendations from government health authorities.”
 
Boeing had already halted production in January of its bestselling plane, the 737 MAX, which has been grounded since March 2019 following the second of two crashes that killed 346 people. The wider shutdown has curtailed production of its sole remaining commercial cash cow, the 787 Dreamliner. It has continued to produce the 787 at its factory in South Carolina.
 
 
Figuring out how to adjust production to reduce the risk of workplace transmission of the virus is only one of Boeing and rival Airbus’ problems.
 
With its airline customers in crisis amid the pandemic, which has led to a steep drop in air travel, Boeing and Airbus may be facing a period of years of lower demand for planes.
 
“This is a possible prelude to a longer shutdown,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant with the Teal Group."

She was 86. Sutherland announced his mother’s death on Twitter, saying she succumbed to complications surrounding pneumonia. He said it was not related to COVID-19. ``""My mother was an extraordinary woman who led an extraordinary life,″ said Sutherland. ``Sadly she had been battling for her health for quite some time and we, as a family, knew this day was coming.″ A native of Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Douglas worked with directors including Stanley Kubrick (""``Lolita″) and David Cronenberg (``""Dead Ringers″), and she won a Gemini Award for her performance in the 1999 TV film ``""Shadow Lake.″ She tirelessly supported a variety of causes throughout her life, including the civil rights movement, the Black Panthers and the fight to save Canada's public healthcare, pioneered by her politician father. In 1965, Douglas married Canadian actor Donald Sutherland, with whom she had two children before they divorced — twins Rachel, a production manager, and Kiefer, who became a film and TV star in his own right. Douglas had another son, Thomas, from a previous marriage. Born April 2, 1934, Douglas showed an early interest in the arts as well as politics as she journeyed on the campaign trail with her father, who became premier of Saskatchewan, a national leader in the New Democratic Party and a socialist icon. She attended the Banff School of Fine Arts and later studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in England, where she acted in theater and TV and participated in anti-nuclear marches. In the 1960s and ’70s, while living in California, Douglas campaigned against the Vietnam War and protested for various causes. She helped to establish a fundraising group called Friends of the Black Panthers. Her support for the group brought controversy — she was refused a U.S. work permit and charged in 1969 with conspiracy to possess unregistered explosives. The courts eventually dismissed the case and exonerated her. She also was a co-founder of the first chapter in Canada of the Performing Artists for Nuclear Disarmament. Douglas, though, was foremost a champion for Canada's medicare system. She would speak of the importance of a universal healthcare system at virtually any opportunity and lobbied government officials. Douglas, who had lived in Toronto since 1977, was nominated for two other Canadian arts Geminis: in 1998 for her leading role in the series ``""Wind at My Back″ and in 1993 for starring in the film `""Passage of the Heart.″ She was also an Officer of the Order of Canada, one of the country's highest honors, and an inductee into Canada’s Walk of Fame."

to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading within their own facilities and to the larger communities they serve. Employees called Amazon facilities a ""breeding ground"" for coronavirus infection, with social distancing measures ""impossible"" and a scarce supply of hand sanitizers and cleaning products.While some Amazon workers can afford not to go to work, others feel that they are forced to choose between their health and their livelihood.Beyond forcing workers to put their lives at risk, one Amazon driver worried that she was helping spread the novel virus: ""I'm too worried that I have infected 1000 people in the last three days.""Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.



As thousands of businesses across the country close their doors to help slow the spread of the coronavirus across the country, Amazon, deemed an ""essential business,"" is one of a few major multinational corporations that have continued to operate.  While the company's operations have largely carried on business as usual, the fear of catching the coronavirus at Amazon warehouses is now palpable, employees told Business Insider. A quiet cough or small sneeze would usually pass without much notice — but now they boom across the facility, flaring anxieties and prompting some employees to walk out in the middle of a shift. While some Amazon workers can afford not to go to work, others feel that they are forced to choose between their health and their livelihood. Business Insider spoke with eight Amazon workers in Pennsylvania, Texas, Kentucky, Arizona, and California who say they're afraid to go to work — and they claim that Amazon is not doing enough to prevent the novel coronavirus from spreading within their own facilities and to the larger communities they serve. Kristen Kish, a spokesperson for Amazon told Business Insider told that the company is monitoring the situation in its facilities and are taking ""proactive measures to protect employees and associates who have been in contact with anyone who has been diagnosed or becomes ill.""



""Like most global companies, we've had employees affected by this, and we're doing all that we can to protect our employees and take the proper precautions as stated in WHO guidelines,"" Kish told Business Insider.With hundreds or even thousands of workers packed into a warehouse at a time — rendering social distancing measures ""impossible"" — and a scarce supply of hand sanitizers and cleaning products, employees called Amazon facilities a ""breeding ground"" for coronavirus infection. And, despite having confirmed COVID-19 cases at several warehouses, they claim that management refused to temporarily close down their locations to clean the entire facility despite employee requests. ""It's leaving us to choose our health or our finances,"" one Amazon worker from Houston who wished to remain anonymous told Business Insider. ""Everybody looks scared, but we can't afford not to go to work."" ""It's leaving us to choose our health or our families."" At an Amazon location in Houston, Texas, one warehouse employee who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation told Business Insider that there are at least five employees who have tested positive for the coronavirus where she works. 



""This disease is killing people on a daily basis,"" she said. ""As people are testing positive for it where I work,  they still expect for us to come there.""With two kids at home full-time due to school closures, she said she can't risk bringing home the virus to her children. The single mom has been forced to take off work so she can take care of her kids — but that also means less money to support the family.""I can't afford to risk my health — my health is more important than a paycheck,"" she said, noting that she is afraid she will come in contact with the virus while at work.""But, I'm also afraid that I'm not going to have the money that I need to take care of my bills when it's all over,"" she said.After the Houston location confirmed that employees had tested positive for coronavirus, the warehouse associate claimed that the company refused to shut down the facility for deep cleaning and has barely increased their normal cleaning schedules.

 Although management claimed to be following CDC mandates, she said that hand sanitizer is scarce and cleaning supplies to disinfect their working areas are often in short supply.



For warehouse associates, she added that social distancing was ""impossible.""""There's no way to forcefully make somebody stay six feet from one another, especially with the type of work that we do,"" she said, pointing to warehouse assembly lines where workers constantly come into close contact with each other. According to Amazon, that ""this is simply not true,"" Kish said, adding that the company ""adjusted practices to ensure social distancing within our buildings, including no stand-up meetings, moving chairs and tables in breakdowns and adjusting shift start and end times.""However, Business Insider previously reported that an Amazon fulfillment center in Indiana appeared to show a lack of social distancing — the facility later confirmed that an employee tested positive for the novel virus. By failing to take enough precautionary measures to protect their workers, she felt that Amazon was forcing its workers to choose between their health and their livelihood. 



""I choose my life, but in their opinion, it's the bottom dollar."" For Amazon employees who are at risk of falling seriously ill if they are infected with the coronavirus, going into work could be a matter of life and death.  For an Amazon worker in Lexington, Kentucky, who is immunocompromised, the decision not to go to work she said protects her from contracting the ""potentially life-threatening"" disease.""I choose my life but, basically, in their opinion, it's the bottom dollar,"" the employee who works in vendor returns told Business Insider, adding that there are no provisions for the elderly or those who can't prove their underlying health conditions. ""I'm not receiving pay during this time and it's creating a dire situation for me."" Every three months, the Kentucky employee receives a steroid shot to control her psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The shot suppresses her immune system, which makes her susceptible to getting infected and falling extremely ill.

 She claimed her facility and most Amazon facilities are a ""natural breeding ground"" for infection with ""people packed into tight quarters"" while high contact surfaces ""aren't regularly cleaned."" She claimed many daytime and nighttime workers share equipment like carts or computers, which she claimed are often dusty, dirty, and difficult to keep clean at the Kentucky facility.""There's this revolving door of germs [that's] happening from the day shift, night shift using the same items over and over,"" she said, adding that her vendor returns department, which is not an essential service, shouldn't still be operating in the first place.  



Kish disputed the Kentucky employee's claims and told Business Insider that Amazon had ""increased the frequency and intensity of cleaning at all sites including regular sanitation of all door handles, stairway handrails, turnstiles, elevator buttons, lockers, and touch screens, to name a few.""Due to her condition and Amazon's failure to provide face maks or protective gear, she has not gone into work since early March. Although going to work poses a threat to her health, she said she may be forced to go back to work to make ends meet. ""I'm basically stuck where I can't collect unemployment. I don't feel safe going to work,"" the 50-year-old told Business Insider. ""I'm concerned about my income, I might be forced to go back. I don't want to go back anytime soon.""""I just want my family to be safe…I can't bring poison into their home."" After an Amazon worker in Phoenix, Arizona confirmed he had been infected by the coronavirus, many employees simply walked off the site, the Arizona Republic reported. One Phoenix, Arizona associate who wished to keep their identity a secret, said his anxieties over transmitting the coronavirus from his facility to his family has made it almost impossible for him to work. ""Every day, I'm walking out within an hour of work,"" the associate told Business Insider. ""So, when I can't take it mentally, I just go home.""



For the unidentified Phoenix employee, bringing the virus home from work could deal a devastating blow to his family. He told Business Insider that his family was at high risk of falling seriously ill if infected by the coronavirus — his brother suffers from extreme asthma while both his parents are over the age of 60. ""I just want my family to be safe… I can't bring poison into their home,"" he said.

 In addition to leaving the job early, the employee and several of his colleagues have started to refuse freight coming from the warehouse with positive COVID-19 employees. Although his facility has started to implement social distancing measures more seriously since discovering employees had contracted the virus, he said it's far from enough. ""We need a stable and sterile supply chain for the customers and the workers,"" the 37-year-old said. ""[Amazon is] putting a lot of people at risk because these things move at an exponential pace. And that means that it can hurt a lot of people in little to no time.""   He even began to organize with fellow employees, writing the governor and other public officials to demand that the Amazon warehouses be closed and completely disinfected before resuming work. Until then, he said he will continue to fight until Amazon protects its workers from the virus.  



""This company is not doing enough and this fight is bigger than our pay,"" he said. In regards to closing down Amazon facilities with confirmed cases of COVID-19, Kish said Amazon is currently consulting with local and federal health authorities and medical experts on how to handle building closures for deep cleaning.""Our process evaluates where the employee was in the building, for how long, how much time has passed since they were onsite, and who they interacted with, among other items, in determining how to appropriately handle the situation,"" Kish told Business Insider. ""Going to work is risky… it's a scary calculation I make every day."" At the Amazon facilities in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, there are as many as 18 confirmed coronavirus cases — and Dominica Mercuri told Business Insider that she may be one of them. The 29-year-old outbound associate who picks, packs and ships customer orders began experiencing symptoms associated with coronavirus including a dry cough, extreme fatigue, and a fever on March 27 — the same day her facility announced that an employee had tested positive for COVID-19. According to Andrea Houtsch, another associate at the same Pennsylvania facility, there are now as many as 18 confirmed cases in their buildings. 



However, due to her age and lack of pre-existing conditions, Mercuri's local hospital refused to administer a test. Without enough proof that she could have the novel virus, she has been forced to take off work without any pay.""No pay is hard to live with,"" she told Business Insider. ""I need to get in that building so I can get paid. They're not paying me to stay home since I don't have a diagnosis."" Having already used up most of her paid time off in the week she took to recover, Mercuri said she needs to work just five more days this week to pay her rent and bills. ""Going to work is risky,"" Mercuri said, adding that her mother who lives with her is at risk of falling seriously ill if she contracted Covid-19. ""It's a scary calculation I make every day.""

 After announcing that there were confirmed cases at the Pennsylvania warehouses, she said the facility was ""back to business as usual."" Although she claims that her facility is making some attempts to improve conditions for workers amid the outbreak in the facilities, she claimed their ""half measures aren't good enough."" The facility tried to implement social distancing measures and provide sanitary wipes for employees, but she said they were never available when she needed them. 



Kish, however, claimed that ""disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are already standard across our network, and the procurement teams have worked tirelessly to create new sources of supply to keep these critical items flowing.""""Like all businesses grappling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic,"" she added, ""it is not easy as supplies are limited, but we are working hard to keep employees safe while serving communities and the most vulnerable.""While Mercuri's Amazon facility has successfully revamped their break rooms so that employees can stay six feet apart, their work stations are still so close people have accidentally coughed and sneezed on her. ""When push comes to shove and our stocks are only rising like right now, we need to get those numbers out the door,"" Mercuri told Business Insider. ""Editing our stations enough to keep us safe and actually keep us six feet away would take away from production. So it's not gonna happen unless there's some kind of outside intervention.""""I'm worried that I have infected 1000 people in the last three days."" Kathy Knight, a driver lead for Amazon, told Business Insider that she wasn't afraid that she could contract the virus — she was afraid that she was helping spread it. 



""I have now visited 190 homes in my community. If that virus is on the box or if I'm carrying the virus and I sneezed or coughed on your package, it's now sitting on your front porch,"" Knight told Business Insider. ""The person that answers the door to pick that package up could get that virus off that box or bag.""As a driver for Amazon, in Pennsylvania, Knight told Business Insider that she makes anywhere from 150 to 196 stops each day, delivering as many as 300 packages. Each of those packages had been touched by countless Amazon employees and drivers, some of whom could be carrying the virus.

 Both she and her 22-year-old son, who also works as an Amazon driver, were both tested for COVID-19 last week after he began showing symptoms associated with the disease. Knight believed that her son may have caught the virus while delivering to Jefferson Hospital where there have been COVID-19 cases.  Citing studies that show the novel coronavirus can live on cardboard or plastic anywhere from one to three days, Knight said she stopped working on March 30 out of fear that she was infecting her customers. ""I told my boss, 'I just don't know if I can do this. I'm too worried that I have infected 1000 people in the last three days,'"" Knight told Business Insider. ""If it came back to me that I had made somebody sick or possibly died from me delivering a package — I don't know how I would get all the rest of my life with that."""

 Enterprises are predicted to spend $12.6B on cloud security tools by 2023, up from $5.6B in 2018, according to Forrester.
 
 Enterprise spending on cloud security solutions is predicted to increase from $636M in 2020 to $1.63B in 2023, attaining a 26.5% CAGR.   
 
 Spending on Infrastructure Protection is predicted to increase from $18.3B in 2020 to $24.6B in 2023, attaining a 7.68% CAGR.
 
 Endpoint security tools are 24% of all I.T. security spending, and by 2020 global I.T. security spending will reach $128B according to Morgan Stanley Research.
 
 70% of all breaches still originate at endpoints, despite the increased I.T. spending on this threat surface, according to IDC.
 

 
 
Cybersecurity now dominates the priorities of every organization as each adapts to a post-COVID 19 world. Remote workers identities’ and devices are the new security perimeter. This is what Zero Trust Security was designed for, and the post-pandemic world is its acid test and crucible. To learn more about how zero trust works, be sure to watch Forrester Principal Analyst Dr. Chase Cunningham’s video, Zero Trust, in Practice here. Dr. Cunningham’s latest book Cyber Warfare – Truth, Tactics, And Strategies, is a good read. Cyber attackers are quick to attack new unprotected threat surfaces created when tens of millions of employees started working from home. In a post-COVID-19 world, cybersecurity is as critical as Internet access itself.  
 
Key insights from the series of cybersecurity market forecasts and market estimates include the following:
 
 
 
 The global cybersecurity market is currently worth $173B in 2020, growing to $270B by 2026. By 2026, 77% of cybersecurity spending will be for externally managed security services.  While money spent on in-house or internal cybersecurity functions is expected to grow 7.2% each year to 2026, global spending on external cybersecurity products and services is projected to increase by 8.4% annually over the same period.

 Network, data, and endpoint security are the three leading use cases of A.I. in cybersecurity today, according to I.T. executives. Capgemini interviewed I.T. executives from ten nations to gain new insights into A.I.’s most popular use cases for cybersecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated each of these use cases, with endpoint security becoming the most urgent priority, as nearly every organization has employees working from home.

 The global cybersecurity market is predicted to grow from $167.1B in 2019 to $248.26B by 2023, attaining a 10.4% CAGR, according to Statista. Worldwide security spending on Identity Access Management reached $10.58B in 2019. The study also found that spending on security services, the largest segment of the information security market, reached $64.24B in 2019 as well. Source: Statista.

 Over 42% of endpoints experience encryption failures, leaving entire networks at risk from a breach and 100% of all devices experiencing encryption failures within one year. They’re most commonly disabled by users, malfunction, or have error conditions or have never been installed correctly in the first place. Absolute Software’s 2019 Endpoint Security Trends Report found that endpoints often failed due to the fragile nature of their encryption agents’ configurations. 2% of encryption agents fail every week, and over half of all encryption failures occurred within two weeks, fueling a constant 8% rate of decay every 30 days. Multiple endpoint security solutions conflict with each other and create more opportunities for breaches than avert them. The study is based on data gathered from over 1B change events on over 6M devices is the basis of the multi-phased methodology. The devices represent data from 12,000 anonymized organizations across North America and Europe. Each device had Absolute’s endpoint visibility and control platform activated.

 Enterprises who lead their industries in cyber resilience rely in A.I. to reduce the number of successful attacks and deliver a more consistent quality of response. Accenture found that when it comes to cyber resilience, there is an elite group of leader companies that comprised 17% of their sample, with 74% being average performers. Leaders know which technologies help to achieve a broader level of cybersecurity success. According to Accenture, non-leaders should consider refocusing their investment priorities toward the technologies which bring benefits that help to fill in some of the performance gaps and achieve a broader level of cybersecurity success.

The donation, the group said, will be going toward the Chicago Community COVID-19 Response Fund and support “local nonprofit organizations serving our region’s most vulnerable neighbors.”

“Chicago is the city we grew up in,” the group said in the announcement on Friday. “It’s important to us that we give back and support the community and local heroes who are on the front lines any way we can.”

“No act of kindness is too small right now,” the continued. “Check in with the people you love. Support the businesses you love if you can. Stay vigilant and hopeful. Everyone is affected by this, and we win by coming together and thinking of the world as bigger of ourselves.”

The group said the money will help support local food banks in the area and provide “direct monetary support for those who have suffered loss of income and jobs as a result of COVID-19, and much more.”

According to the latest data from the Chicago Department of Public Health, over 4,600 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the city’s residents as of Sunday afternoon, as well as 98 deaths."

      Lee Fierro -- who portrayed Alex Kintner's mom, Mrs. Kintner, in the 1975 classic film -- has passed away due to complications from coronavirus ... according to Martha's Vineyard Times, which first reported her death. The first ""Jaws"" was shot on location there in Mass.

  

    

    
      Fierro doesn't have very many acting credits to her name outside of the 'Jaws' franchise -- in which she reprised her role twice -- but she had an iconic few scenes in the first flick, notably her freak-out on the beach when Alex's blood and shorts wash up on the beach.

  

    
      Perhaps even more iconic ... her confrontation with Roy Scheider, who played Chief Brody, whom she slapped across the face at Alex's wake. She was pissed he let beachgoers hit the sand despite knowing there was a shark on the loose. Her son was the second-known attack, and as Chief Brody noted ... she wasn't wrong for her criticism of him.

  

    

    
      According to the outlet, Fierro was being housed at assisted living facility in Ohio -- where her family is said to be holding a small ceremony in her honor because of social distancing restrictions."

Apple will produce face shields for medical workers, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a video on Sunday.

The company is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week.

""We've launched a company-wide effort, bringing together product designers, engineering, operations and packaging teams, and our suppliers to design, produce, and ship face shields for health workers,"" Cook said.

""Our first shipment was delivered to Kaiser hospital facilities in the Santa Clara Valley this past week and the feedback from doctors was very positive.""

Cook said that Apple's face shield design can be packed 100 to a box and can be assembled in two minutes.

Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. Cook also said that Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.

Because of the coronavirus outbreak, Apple's corporate employees in California are currently working from home and its retail stores are closed indefinitely."

My name's Stephen LaConte, I'm a writer here at BuzzFeed, and according to my friends and family, I'm pretty darn good at giving advice.
    
  



  
  



      
    
      



      
        
      
    
      


  
  



  
    

    
      We've got two urgent DMs to answer today, so let's get to it!
    
  








      
    
      



      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      First, we've got this anonymous young woman, whose time in COVID-19 isolation has her tempted to sext her ex:
    
  







  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  
    
  
  
  


  
    

    
      Okay, first of all, it seems like a whole lot of people are getting horny in quarantine — so many, in fact, that actual medical doctors are being asked to explain it. So you definitely aren't alone on that front, my friend.
    
  


  
    

    


  

  

  


      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Still, I'm gonna tell you NOT to sext with your ex. Because there's one thing worse than being horny in quarantine, and that is being SAD in quarantine.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Your ex is an ex for a reason. And while sexting with them might solve your loneliness problem, it's likely to create a million new problems in your life as soon as the digital deed is done.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Look. You've only been broken up for a few months. That's still very recent! It's likely you'd be having these temptations even if there wasn't a worldwide pandemic happening right now. Missing your ex after a breakup is quite natural — but it's also a big, fat trap. Don't fall for it!
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Find ways to distract yourself whenever you start to miss them. Take up a new hobby, deep-clean your apartment, do some at-home workouts, catch up with old friends. Heck, get on Tinder and go on some FaceTime dates. For better or worse, we're all finding ourselves with PLENTY of free time right now. Use it to invest in yourself, not your ex.
    
  







  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      As for any lingering quarantine horniness? Well, far be it from me to promote any other website than BuzzFeed, but I think there are more than a few places online that can help you out with that, if ya know what I mean.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      


  
  



  
    

    
      Good luck, steer clear of your ex, and go wash your hands.
    
  








      
    
      



      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Next up, we've got this bride-to-be, who isn't sure whether to invite her parents to her wedding:
    
  







  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Nah, don't invite your parents. Your wedding should be a day to celebrate and enjoy yourself, and I don't think that will happen with your estranged parents staring you down from Table 2.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Full disclosure: My advice might be different if I thought your parents were capable of showing up and behaving themselves. But you say they'll revolt if they don't get to walk you down the aisle. To not speak to you for a year and then demand aisle-walking privileges is, frankly, nuts, and tells me they don't understand boundaries. So this is one boundary you'll have to set for them — by leaving them off the guest list.

      You mention that people close to you are urging you to invite your parents. I'm sure these folks mean well, and in fairness to them, wedding culture has brainwashed all of us! We live in a world where third cousins, random coworkers, and creepy uncles all somehow work their way onto the wedding guest list — so OF COURSE your parents should be there too, right?
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Except your parents shouldn't be there, because you don't have a relationship with them, and their presence is likely to ruin an otherwise happy occasion. It's really that simple! So let your friends know your decision, and ask them to respect it.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      Remember that your wedding is just one day of your life. There will be other days when you and your parents can work toward reconciliation — days when you aren't busy, y'know, getting married and stuff. That's assuming you even want to reconcile — maybe you don't! In any event, a wedding is not the place to heal deep familial wounds.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      



  
  



  
    

    
      I'm glad you mentioned your ""homemade family."" It sounds like you'll be surrounded by people who love and support you on your wedding day. That's what really matters. Stick with those people, and I don't think you'll have any regrets.
    
  






  
    
    
  





      
    
      


  
  



  
    

    
      Well, that's all the advice I'm giving today, folks. But now it's your turn — sound off in the comments with YOUR best advice for today's letter writers. I'll be reading...

(AP) — Some Kentucky churches held Palm Sunday services in defiance of Gov. Andy Beshear’s warning against in-person worship.

Dozens of people were at Maryville Baptist Church in Louisville on Sunday, news outlets reported. A video showed a pianist playing and choir members singing during the late morning service.

Beshear warned during his daily briefing on Sunday that if facilities are still allowing mass gatherings, then ""perhaps those facilities shouldn’t be allowed to be open anymore.”

Maryville Baptist Preacher Jack Roberts had told The Courier Journal that he would rather go to jail and court than pay a fine for violating the March 19 order of Kentucky’s health department.

He said the prohibition violates First Amendment and state constitutional rights. Roberts said he has encouraged social distancing at his church and asked people at high risk of infection to stay home and watch livestreamed services.

Beshear said in direct reference to Roberts that ""at Christmas he’s going to have fewer people in his congregation. My faith would never let me put someone’s health in that position.”

Louisville’s Our Savior Lutheran Church streamed its in-person service live on YouTube. The church had required online registration beforehand and restricted seating to every other pew. The video stream did not show the audience although one person's head could be seen.

Pastor Joshua Cook asked churchgoers to pray for medical and emergency services workers and National Guard members “who are serving in this time of crisis.”

Some states, including Florida, have made exemptions to allow religious gatherings to proceed during the coronavirus. Kentucky does not have that exemption.

Before it became an order, Beshear first issued guidance that churches cancel in-person services on March 11.

Beshear said Kentucky has at least 955 positive virus cases and 45 deaths.

Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia, sometimes requiring hospitalization. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems.

“We are also beginning to manufacture hand sanitizer at some of our plants, and will be donating it to those in need,” company officials said in a statement Sunday. “Additionally, we continue to supply critical products to create and maintain clean and healthy environments for customers who support vital health care facilities, manufacturing plants, and other infrastructure.”

Sherwin-Williams representatives said they have also donated “critical coatings products to producers of ventilators, oxygen tanks and hospital bedframes.”

But the company’s generosity does not end there. It also donated $100,000 to the Cleveland Rapid Response Fund to assist the work of public health officials.

Sherwin-Williams joins a growing list of companies that are contributing their services to help battle the coronavirus pandemic. At least 65 other American companies are either offering free meals to healthcare workers or are producing ventilators, masks, or other protective equipment."

When the unnamed firefighter opened his hospital room window Friday morning, he could not believe what he saw, according to the Henry Herald.

In the street below was the bright yellow firetruck from his station and several fellow crew members who had gathered to show him how much they cared about him.

On Twitter Friday, the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Department (MDFR) shared video footage of the event captured by the recovering firefighter.

“There they are, all this for me,” he said from behind the camera as the crew prepared to bring the ladder up to his fourth story window.

“They’re setting up, they have ‘get well soon’ cards. Soon they’re going to bring the ladder over here and they’re all gonna come up and say hi,” he continued.

The fireman, who has been in the hospital for over a week since contracting the virus, said he felt “joyful” and “instantly connected” to his team the second they showed up outside the building.

When the ladder reached the window, one of the crew members climbed up and smiled while holding Get Well Soon cards and a sign that read “Your New Firehouse.”

“This is love. This is the only kind of love you can get from the brother and sisterhood at the firehouse,” the fireman said of the kind gesture.

“There’s just no other way to explain how this makes me feel, being locked up in here. Everybody that walks in here, you can’t even see their face because of masks and gowns. I mean, it’s completely understandable but you feel so isolated from the world,” he concluded.

Following the heart warming event, Twitter users offered their own well wishes and encouraged him to stay strong.

“Get well soon! We need you,” one person wrote.

“Keep Fighting, you are not alone brother,” another commented."

The California Republican questioned if the Chinese communist government had actually learned anything from it.

“This is a China communist cover-up,” McCarthy said. “Because if you watch the doctor who gave the warning, you cannot find him anymore. The University of Southampton did a study, had China been honest with the world, 95% fewer people would have been sick. That means it would have been controlled and contained inside China if they would have just allowed when President Trump requested our scientists, our researchers, our doctors, we would have contained that there.”

“Now, what we’re finding and you’re watching China still open up these wet markets, have enough people died for them to understand?” he continued. “Has there been enough financial destruction not just in China and in America, but around the world every single day, and they continue to deny it. Their own numbers are a lie. You know, there is a recent study out there that I saw on this report, Wuhan where this originated from, they estimate 43,000 people in China died there. We will not know because they killed the doctors. They don’t give the real reporting.”

“And because of their cover-up, we’re having more than a million people have this virus and the thousands of people who have died,” McCarthy added."

A tiger at the Bronx Zoo in New York City has tested positive for the coronavirus, in what may be the first confirmed case of an animal being infected with the virus in the U.S. 
The tiger is a 4-year-old female from Malaysia, officials said. Three other tigers and three African lions also have developed a dry cough and were expected to recover, according to the zoo, which has been closed to the public since March 16.

The National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed the tiger's positive COVID-19 test.
""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution"" and aimed to ""contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" Dr. Paul Calle, the zoo's chief veterinarian, said.
""Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,"" Wildlife Conservation Society [WCS], which has managed the Bronx Zoo, announced in a statement. ""It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.""
WCS added that an employee who'd showed no symptoms while caring for the cats infected the tiger.
""Appropriate preventive measures are now in place for all staff who are caring for them, and the other cats in our four WCS zoos, to prevent further exposure of any other of our zoo cats,"" the organization added.
WILD ANIMALS HAVE TAKEN OVER THE STREETS IN MAJOR CITIES BECAUSE OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC
U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] officials have said there were no known cases of the virus in U.S. pets or livestock.
""It's important to assure pet owners and animal owners that at this time there isn't any evidence that they can spread the virus,"" Dr. Jane Rooney, a veterinarian and USDA official, said.
Health experts said the coronavirus outbreaks around the world have been driven by person-to-person transmission. 
There have been some reports of pets outside the U.S. becoming infected after close contact with contagious people. In Hong Kong, a dog tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture officials concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the coronavirus to humans but could test positive if their owners exposed them to the virus.

Time management is one of the most common issues in the way of productivity under normal circumstances. But we are operating in strange times. Working from home automatically comes with its own additional time management challenges under regular circumstances. But we are all dealing with time management on top of the undeniably chaotic events that are unfolding due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 
“An important distinction between working remotely in this circumstance and remote work in general is that our remote work today is happening on a platform in an extreme state of uncertainty and anxiety. Now is the time to have compassion with each other,“ recommends Matt Martin, Co-Founder and CEO of Clockwise. In our interview he shared insights on how workers are adjusting to working from home. Clockwise has optimized calendars for thousands of workers at hundreds of companies (from Lyft to Asana to Slack), giving Matt unique insights on how people are spending their work time - including how much time is wasted on low-value tasks and non-work related things like reading the news and social media.
 
Some tips he had for all of us to consider to set us up for success during this unique time include:
 
Embrace that meetings are increasing. Over the past few weeks, he and his company had a bird’s eye view into how many of us have shifted our time management while moving into a full, work from home operating model. Within the first week of ‘shelter in place’ Clockwise saw a 12% increase in meetings in their clients compared to just a week before. Without the ability to have the organic conversations that in-person offices allow, virtual meetings, whether impromptu or scheduled, will be the lifeblood of how people engage with one another.
 
 
Pay attention to fragmented time.  Fragmented time occurs due to the small pockets of 15 to 30-minute blocks of time that exist between scheduled meetings. These can work well as breathing space if planned for intentionally. But most of us are very passive with our calendars. People schedule us for meetings based on what works for them and the open space they spot in our calendars. But that may leave you very little time to actually get work done and the fragmented time ends up sucked up in busy but unproductive activities. 
 
Hone your boundary setting skills. This will have to be done both with your work team and your home team. If you are sharing a living space with roommates, spouses, children or just a gang of hyper dogs, you will need to get structured about space and work hours. On the work side, discuss with your manager and team members what hours should be focused time and what needs to be available for meetings and impromptu calls. 
 
 
Proactively manage your calendar. Instead of leaving your calendar as a blank open slate for others to populate, set your time up to support getting work done. Every Friday, spend time plotting chunks of focused time in advance for you to meet the demands of the projects or responsibilities you’re managing for the next two weeks. Treat the time as a locked meeting the same way you would if you were meeting others. Don’t tag it as tentative. You can always change the meeting if priorities are pushing for that time but you want to stick to holding it for focused work as much as possible.
 
Don’t be part of the problem. Jason Fried, author of the book, “Rework,” and co-founder and president of 37 Signals says, “These two staples of work life – meetings and managers – are actually the greatest causes of work not getting done at the office.” Well now we’re not in the office but are we still contributing to holding unnecessary or meaningless meetings? 
 
It’s tough to balance how much is too much when it comes to meetings when managers have to consider the need to connect with their teams for morale reasons, to gauge engagement and productivity and to simply keep their teams updated. The best solution is to come up with a short list of meeting rules of engagement that everyone abides by. Work with the team as a whole to determine the best frequency and purpose of meetings to set everyone up for success.
 
Manage your work from home guilt. The popular issue that circulates when the topic of working remotely gets brought up is how will managers ensure employees aren’t abusing the system. In reality, most employees end up working way more hours than they did in the office. 
 
It’s easy for someone to get caught up working from morning till night when already at home. At least in the office, there’s the element of needing to go home to get some sleep. The other side is the concern that we don’t know how to show up in a way that keeps us visible to the powers to be. Our guilt can drive us to work longer hours in hopes to show our usefulness. But that’s a recipe for burnout. Be sure to lay out clear office hours with your manager. Work to have the focus be on results vs. visible time on the computer.
 
Prioritize energy management. Being sensitive to one another’s energy helps us all work more effectively. Pay attention to when you are the most productive and focused. It may be the first few hours in the morning, when you’re fresh from a night’s sleep. Or it may be towards the afternoon when you start to get a sense of what really needs to get done. Work to schedule your calendar to align with those energy windows. Discuss how to coordinate those energy windows with the energy windows of the others on your team.
 
Be sure to consider what your family or personal obligations are at this time. Discuss what you can with your manager and team so everyone is able to support one another’s energy ups and downs during this time.
 
Lead with compassion. If you’re a manager, it’s easy to get obsessed on whether people are taking advantage of this time at home or actually working. As mentioned earlier, these are strange and stressful times. Now is the time to extend compassion, assumption of good intent and a culture of support. Everyone is tackling this time with more than just work concerns. How you respect people’s need for time and privacy can make a huge impact on how everyone comes through all this and operates together on the other side.
 
In the end, time is one of our most valuable, if not most valuable, resource. To allow these circumstances to cause us to waste time or spend it on things that don’t matter will only add to the stress all the recent changes we’ve been thrust into. Time management has become more than just a tool for productivity, it’s now a way to create more meaning, stability and empowerment through all the chaos of change each of us face."

their refusal to issue the kind of directives implemented across most of the nation, covering more than 300 million Americans, to combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Some say the specific circumstances of their state doesn’t merit such a mandate, others have advocated social responsibility instead, and yet others have expressed a preference for following the advice of their state officials.

The governors do have one significant trait in common: They’re all Republican.

Of course, so is President Donald Trump, who has resisted calls for a national mandate that might send the strongest, most unambiguous message about the importance of social distancing to curb spread of the virus.

It’s doubtful the president can actually supersede the governors’ authority in this area, but he could strengthen federal guidelines that stop short of directing citizens to remain at home except for essential activities.

In the absence of such a command, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming continue to allow their residents relatively free movement.

Legal experts have said Trump doesn’t have the authority to impose a national lockdown as the heads of countries such as Italy, Spain, France and Britain have done. But he does have some tools at his disposal, including the bully pulpit and the ability to restrict air travel between COVID-19 hot spots.

Trump has pointed out some states haven’t had a large number of cases. Those tend to be sparsely populated states in the middle of the country, such as Wyoming, North Dakota and South Dakota. As of Sunday, none of them had more than 215 cases, although their numbers were rising.

While some states call for shelter-in-place orders, others are calling their directives stay-at-home orders. The directives differ by location but generally require people to avoid all nonessential outings and stay inside as much as possible.

They allow residents to continue performing tasks essential to the health and safety of family and pets. It's still fine to buy groceries, go for a run, walk the dog, pick up medicine, visit a doctor or get supplies to work from home.

Federal guidelines give state and local authorities leeway in what they consider ""essential"" businesses during an emergency. But in general, those industries include grocery stores and food production, pharmacies, health care, utilities, shipping, banking, other governmental services, law enforcement, emergency services and news outlets.

Here's what the mandates to fight off the coronavirus look like in each state as of Sunday:

Gov. Kay Ivey issued a stay-at-home order on April 3, which went into effect at 5 p.m. on April 4.

""I can’t say this any more clearly—#COVID19 is an imminent threat to our way of life, & you need to understand that we’re past urging people to stay home. It is NOW the law,"" Ivey said in a tweet announcing the order.

The Last Frontier on March 27 implemented what it's calling a “social distancing” mandate, which is similar to a shelter-in-place order. Gov. Mike Dunleavy directed residents to stay at home and banned most travel within the state. Visitors to Alaska also have to self-quarantine.

“We crossed a line today for Alaska,” Dunleavy said after the state's first death linked to the coronavirus.

Gov. Doug Ducey’s ""Stay Home, Stay Healthy, Stay Connected"" order, announced March 30, that would extend until April 30.

Gov. Asa Hutchinson has directed residents not to gather in groups larger than 10 but has not forced them to stay in. “I do not want to go to a shelter-in-place environment,” Hutchinson said.

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a statewide shelter-in-place order March 19, and identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors to remain open – including those providing food, health care and energy.

""This is a dynamic situation,"" Newsom said. ""I don't expect this to be many, many months, but for the time being, we are recognizing the next eight weeks"" as especially important.

Gov. Jared Polis on March 25 issued a statewide stay-at-home order that went into effect the next morning and will run until April 11. The order stipulates that Coloradans should leave their homes only for ""critical activities.""

""Now is the time to stay at home,” Polis said. ""You have the chance to be a hero and save thousands of lives by staying at home. The lives of many Coloradans hinge on your ability to be able to stay at home for the next couple weeks to the most of your ability ... Now is not the time to die.""

'Not just a big city issue': Coronavirus cases soar in rural America popular with tourists

Gov. Ned Lamont announced an executive order March 20 that directed all nonessential businesses and not-for-profit entities to prohibit all in-person functions if possible. The order excludes essential business, such as health care, food service, law enforcement and similar critical services.

The order recommended that people maintain social distancing, limit outdoor recreational activities to non-contact and limit the use of public transportation, among other items.

Gov. John Carney ordered residents of The First State to stay at home and closed nonessential businesses, on March 24.

Two days before extending the mandate to the whole state Wednesday, Gov. Ron DeSantis issued a “Safer at Home’’ order that applied to Broward, Miami-Dade, Monroe and Palm Beach counties. Nearly 60% of the state’s cases of coronavirus have been concentrated in those four counties.

Other counties have issued their own orders, and some of the state’s beaches have closed their parking lots to discourage large gatherings. DeSantis has ordered visitors to the state from the New York metro area and Louisiana to self-quarantine for 14 days. The Florida Keys have closed to visitors.

On April 1, Gov. Brian Kemp signed a stay-at-home order that would also keep schools closed through the end of the school year. Before that, the city of Atlanta and Cobb and Gwinnett counties had required residents to stay home.

Gov. David Ige signed a stay-at-home order March 23 that went into effect two days later, prohibiting gatherings of more than 10 people. The order will be effective through April 30.

Residents can leave home ""only for essential activities or to engage in the essential businesses and operations."" As long as social distancing is practiced, ""ocean activities such as surfing and swimming"" are also exempted.

Gov. Brad Little on March 25 signed an ""Order to Self-Isolate"" that became effective immediately and will run for three weeks. The order exempts residents who need to leave for essential activities. Little also signed an ""extreme emergency declaration"" and mobilized the Idaho National Guard ""to support civil authorities and local jurisdictions.""

Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a ""stay-at-home"" order March 20 that began the following day and will last until at least April 7.

All nonessential businesses must close, and all people who can work from home must do so, Pritzker said. All Illinois schools will stay closed until at least April 8.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the order ""is not a lockdown or martial law."" Pharmacies, grocery stores, clinics and airports remain open and garbage is being collected.

Gov. Eric J. Holcomb told residents on March 23 to stay at home until at least April 7, asking ""Hoosiers to hunker down"" in an executive order.

The order gives Indiana State Police and local law enforcement the authority to enforce the order.

Gov. Kim Reynolds has not mandated that Iowans stay home, saying an informal guidance that they do so is “equivalent’’ to an order, although it does not have law-enforcement power.

After citing models that predicted a possible increase of local cases in Kansas to 900 over the following week, Gov. Laura Kelly signed an executive ""stay home"" order March 28. The order became effective March 30 and will run until April 19. It allows Kansans to leave their homes for essential activities.

“I know this is hard, and I can’t tell you how much I wish it weren’t necessary,” Kelly said. “But we have a small window to ensure that Kansas does not suffer the same terrible fate of other hard-hit states like New York and Missouri.""

Gov. Andy Beshear on March 25 signed an order encouraging residents to remain ""Healthy at Home,'' which he later said amounts to a directive to remain in the house except for essential activities. While many medical facilities have complied with a request to cease elective procedures, it became a mandate starting Monday.

He further tightened restrictions, and on March 30 signed an executive order telling Kentuckians they cannot travel outside the state with a few exceptions. If they do, they'll need to self-quarantine for 14 days.

Gov. John Bel Edwards issued a stay-at-home order March 22 for nonessential workers and businesses. The order went into effect the next day. All public schools and many businesses, such as bars and gyms, were already closed by previous executive orders, but the order expanded the closures. On March 30, he extended the order through at least April 30.

Gov. Janet Mills issued a stay-at-home order on March 31 that went into effect on April 2. Portland, the state's largest city, issued its own order on March 25.

As part of a virtual shutdown of the capital region, which has a population of 15 million, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan tightened restrictions in ordering residents to stay home. Maryland is grappling with a major outbreak in one of its nursing homes.

Gov. Charlie Baker on March 23 announced a stay-at-home advisory for all unnecessary activities. The order will run until April 7.

“We’re asking everyone to use their common sense, think about the impact this virus is having on the sick and elderly, and to limit their interactions with other people,'' Baker said.

Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on March 23 signed a ""Stay Home, Stay Safe'' executive order that runs through April 13. Violating the order is a criminal misdemeanor and could bring fines and also result in businesses being shut down.

""I know this will be hard, but it will be temporary,"" Whitmer said. ""If we all come together, get serious, and do our part by staying home, we can stay safe and save lives.”

Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order March 25 that directs residents to stay in their homes and limit movement to essential activities. It runs until April 10 at 5 p.m. The order was based on models released by the Minnesota Department of Health and University of Minnesota that predicted more than 70,000 residents could die if no action was taken.

Gov. Tate Reeves had encouraged residents to stay home but did not mandate it until April 1, when he said at a news conference: ""We know that there are some who still do not have a healthy fear of this virus. They are wrong, and they are risking lives if they do not take this very, very seriously.”

The day before, Reeves had issued such an order for Lauderdale County only.

Among its provisions, the order says residents ""shall avoid leaving their homes or places of residence."" It also closes schools, limits gatherings to 10 people and restricts the operations of non-essential businesses.

Gov. Steve Bullock issued an order March 26 that went into effect two days later, directing residents to stay at home and closing nonessential businesses.

""I'd rather be accused of overreacting than having a health care system overwhelmed and unable to help our most-at-risk Montanans when they need it the most,"" Bullock said.

Gov. Pete Ricketts on April 3 issued an updated directed health measure for the entire state. The order closes restaurant and bars' dining rooms, cancels classes at schools and imposes an 10-person limit on public gathering, among other provisions.

The current order will stay in effect until May 11 and comes as the state reported its sixth COVID-19 death.

On April 1, Gov. Steve Sisolak changed his stay-at-home guidance to a directive, at the same time extending closures of schools and nonessential businesses to April 30.

That meant the rally known as ""Light Up Las Vegas,"" which was to feature a procession of cars down the Strip, was canceled.

Gov. Chris Sununu released an emergency order March 27 mandating the closure of all nonessential businesses and requiring Granite Staters to stay home.

The order is expected to be in place until May 4. The state saw its first death from the virus just days before Sununu's order.

On March 21, Gov. Phil Murphy ordered residents to stay at home. He also canceled gatherings of any number, including parties, weddings and religious ceremonies.

""We have to change our behaviors,"" Murphy said, adding the restrictions would not change ""anytime soon"" and could continue for weeks or months.

Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a public health order that calls for nonessential businesses to be closed until at least April 10.

The order said residents ""should stay at home and undertake only those outings absolutely necessary for their health, safety or welfare."" The order also prohibits gatherings of more than four people.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced March 20 that all New York residents must stay home ""to the maximum extent possible.""

Cuomo called the order the ""New York State on PAUSE"" plan, and it bans all nonessential gatherings of individuals ""of any size for any reason.""

Residents can leave their homes for solitary exercise or to obtain essential services or items, including trips to the grocery store.

After some counties mandated that their residents stay home, Gov. Roy Cooper extended the order statewide on March 27. Calling the decision “a matter of life or death,” Cooper said the order will extend until April 29.

Gov. Doug Burgum shut down all nonessential businesses but has not ordered residents to stay in the house: “It’s not about staying home, it’s about avoiding contact,’’ Burgum said.

Most Indian reservations in the state have either imposed curfews or stay-at-home orders.

Gov. Mike DeWine imposed a mandate for Ohio's residents to stay at home, an order that went into effect March 23.

The order has been extended to May 1 and will be reassessed as necessary, DeWine said. The order can be enforced by local health and law enforcement departments, the governor said.

Gov. Kevin Stitt’s “Safer at Home’’ order only applies to elderly people and those with immuno-deficiencies. However, mandates by the cities of Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Norman apply to all their residents. He also issued an order Sunday requiring travelers from six states – New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California, Louisiana and Washington – to self-quarantine for 14 days.

At an April 1 news conference in which he announced new guidelines, Stitt was pressed about his refusal to direct all state residents to stay home and he said, “In my opinion, I cannot shut things down and bunker in place.”

Gov. Kate Brown told residents on March 20 to stay home, calling the directive ""both an order and a public awareness campaign."" Three days later, Brown made it an official mandate.

“On (March 20), I frankly directed them to stay home,'' Brown said. ""And now I am ordering them to stay home.”

On March 23, Gov. Tom Wolf issued stay-at-home orders for seven counties in Pennsylvania that have been hit hardest, including the areas surrounding Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, its two largest cities. Philadelphia, Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Monroe and Montgomery are the affected counties. On April 1, the order went out for the whole state.

On his verified Twitter account, Wolf had written that ""residents must stay home unless someone’s life depends on leaving.""

Gov. Gina Raimondo on March 28 ordered residents to stay at home until April 13, with some exceptions. Her order also restricts gatherings to no more than five people and requires two-week quarantines of visitors from other states.

Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order that grants law enforcement the authority to ban or disperse public gatherings of more than three people.

""We must all assume we have the virus and we must all assume the people we are talking to have the virus,"" said McMaster, who ordered non-essential businesses to close but did not mandate residents to stay in.

The state's two largest cities, Charleston and Columbia, have ordered their residents to remain at home.

Gov. Kristi Noem has not imposed severe restrictions, but several cities and counties have taken action, including Sioux Falls and Huron. Noem has said she does not believe some of the limits applied to cities work well in smaller towns.

Gov. Bill Lee on March 30 followed the lead of the mayors of cities like Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville and issued a “Safer at Home’’ order that imposes restrictions on residents’ movement and requires nonessential businesses to close. Some smaller cities in the state had previously implemented similar orders.

""This is not a mandated 'shelter in place' order, because it remains deeply important to me to protect personal liberties,"" Lee said.

Gov. Greg Abbott had left decisions on stay-at-home restrictions to local governments rather than issuing a statewide edict, but on March 31 he signed an executive order that said residents should avoid leaving home for the next month except for essential activities. He declined to call it a stay-at-home order but acknowledged that's essentially what it is.

The most populous counties in the state had already taken action, directing their residents to stay home. Among them: Dallas County, Harris County – which includes Houston – Bexar County – which includes San Antonio, Collin County, El Paso County, Tarrant County, Austin and Hunt County.

On March 29, Abbott expanded the state’s mandatory self-quarantine order for travel from coronavirus hot spots, including noncommercial road travel out of Louisiana. The expanded order also includes travelers on flights from Miami, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago and anywhere in California and Washington state. Abbott’s previous quarantine order applied to air travelers from airports in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and New Orleans.

On March 29, Salt Lake County ordered a number of businesses closed and told residents to only venture outside the home for “essential activities.’’ There is no statewide mandate in place from Gov. Gary Herbert.

An order by Gov. Phil Scott requiring that residents stay home went into effect March 25 and is expected to be extended past its current April 15 expiration date.

“I need you to stay home,’’ Scott said. “Doing so will save lives. It’s just that simple.’’

A week before joining forces with Maryland and Washington, D.C., in their stay-at-home decrees, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam had signed an executive order mandating all schools to be closed through the end of the academic year and many nonessential businesses to close for at least 30 days. The order has been extended to June 10.

The order also banned any public or private gatherings of 10 or more people. ""I have said repeatedly, ‘Stay at home unless it’s essential that you go out,''' he said.

The Evergreen State became the first in the country to suffer an outbreak. On March 23, Gov. Jay Inslee signed an order that prohibits Washingtonians from leaving their homes except for essential tasks.

“This is a human tragedy on a scale we cannot yet project,” Inslee said. “It’s time to hunker down in order to win this fight.”

Though West Virginia was the last state in the U.S. to report a confirmed coronavirus case, Gov. Jim Justice issued a stay-at-home order March 23. The order also shut down all nonessential businesses and will last until a subsequent order terminates it.

""Issuing a 'Safer at Home' order isn’t something I thought we’d have to do and it’s not something I take lightly, but here’s the bottom line: folks need to start taking this seriously,"" Evers said.

Gov. Mark Gordon said March 30 he doesn’t plan to order residents to stay at home, as the number of cases in the state climbed near 100.

""If we're going to issue a shelter-in-place or stay-at-home order, it will not have multiple exemptions. It will be a true stay-at-home order,"" said Gordon, who has shut down schools and several businesses through April 17."

With the crisis caused by the coronavirus and COVID-19, the world feels upside down, and nothing is certain. Your work has probably tilted as well. Millions of people have been furloughed, taken wage cuts or are working in completely unexpected circumstances. At a minimum, you are likely working from home and figuring out how to make the best of videoconferencing and collaboration at a distance. 
 
So how can you manage your career through such trying times? 
 
While this may seem like the least likely time to build your career or find new opportunities, in reality, it may be the best. As Albert Einstein said, “In the middle of difficulty, lies opportunity.” Struggle, unexpected circumstances and ambiguity can also pave the way for new possibilities if you’re able to do these six things:
 
First, stay positive and future focused. We all want to work with people who are optimistic and energetic—and this is especially true during tough times like these. In addition, one study found people who were optimistic performed better and had greater satisfaction with their work. In other research, those with greater optimism had less work-related stress. Give yourself permission to be down or uncertain temporarily, but then find a way to move forward and stay positive. It will be good for you, good for your work and good for those around you.
 
 
Take initiative and offer to help. The uncertainty of the work environment can reduce the standard boundaries between job role, departments or functional territories, and this can create opportunity. Raise your hand to help in your own area, but also stay attuned for the potential to contribute in places you don’t normally play. Perhaps a co-worker is working less because he must care for his children and you can assist with his tasks, or maybe your company is solving new problems in service to coronavirus challenges and your skills can contribute in brand new areas. Rather than simply waiting for direction, think broadly about how you can help and step forward to offer your talents in areas that are tried and true or that stretch your skills.
 
Solve new problems and innovate. Your company is likely awash in new problems from re-evaluating the supply chain to helping employees to keeping people engaged and motivated. In these times, every job is different in some way because the context for everything has fundamentally changed. Bring your best novel thinking to these circumstances. Often new innovations come from connecting previously unrelated ideas, or from outside the typical approach. When there is tremendous ambiguity, the time can be ripe for new ideas, new ways of thinking and unexpected solutions. Bring your best creative thinking to the problems your company is seeking to solve. 
 
 
Be a team player. Under stress, people can be less than their best. They may have less patience, less perspective and more anxiety. While this is typical and can happen to all of us, it’s also an opportunity to be your best as a colleague. Find ways to demonstrate empathy and give discretionary effort. Whether you’re providing encouragement for a colleague whose partner was recently laid off, helping a teammate who is struggling with the new video conferencing technology or giving your time to a critical project, be a great team player. Your attitude and contribution are important to your own experience, but also to the experience of those around you. 
 
Be flexible. Be willing to try new things and say yes. It is likely that with so many new problems to solve, your company may need you to step up and potentially contribute outside your typical lane or areas of responsibility. View these as opportunities to go above and beyond and build your skills. Your adaptability will benefit your organization, but it’s also good for your career. 
 
Endure. Finally, stay strong and keep going. You’ve heard it before: this is a marathon, not a sprint, so focus on the long term. “Enthusiasm is common. Endurance is rare,” said psychologist and scientist Angela Duckworth. It may be easy to be positive or flexible for the short term but keep at it and demonstrate ongoing determination. Persistence and perseverance in the face of hardship are the definition of grit, and grit is good—for you, for your career and for your company. 
 
Things are uncertain, upside down and your work may be in flux, but all of this may not be bad news. Stay positive, take initiative, innovate, be a team player and be flexible. Focus on the future and stay strong for the marathon—and these will likely pay off not only for your career in the long term, but also for your peace of mind in the short term."

The conversation provoked an unusual amount of mudslinging online between the two sides of the political aisle.

During the conversation, Adams defended the fact that nine states have not issued shut down orders, and likened the coronavirus to cigarette smoking. Wallace leaped on that comment, saying one is done by choice, the other acquired.

Adams fell into word salad by talking about a report on tobacco cessation released earlier this year. “And we know that states have different laws there. And more people will die, even in the worst projections, from cigarette smoking in this country than are going to die from — from coronavirus this year.  And so we always are struggling with trying to get information out to guide people that we know will help them be healthy with states’ rights.”

Wallace countered, “But, Doctor — but, Dr. Adams, there’s a big difference between opioids and cigarettes, which are something that people decide to use or not to use, and the coronavirus, which people catch. It’s not an individual choice.  And, you know, when President Trump says that he’s a wartime president, during World War II, FDR didn’t say, “Well, it’s up to each state to decide what to do.” He mobilized the nation. Again, why not a national stay-at-home order?  The coronavirus doesn’t recognize states’ rights, so does the federal analogy really work here?

Adams said the governors were intensely protective of their rights. “Well, Chris, I know we could go forever in coronavirus time. But I would remind people that it was just a week ago when the idea of a federal quarantine for the New York City area was being floated, and Governor Cuomo said that would be like declaring war on the state. The governors are intensely protective of their right, and rightly so, to be able to decide what’s best for their states. And we’re going to do everything we can as scientists and as physicians, as medical professionals, to help them understand what we think the right thing is for them to do.”

This is significant because, as relayed by federal officials, the infection is the first known one to be contracted by an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere on the planet.  
The big cat in question is a four-year-old named Nadia. Her condition came to the attention of her handlers after she developed a ""dry cough,"" according the New York Post. After she fell ill, six other tigers and lions also developed that same ""dry cough."" If you're wondering how they got infected, the USDA believes it was passed on to them by a zoo employee. This is supported by evidence that the two species reside in different parts of the zoo, but that they all had contact with the employee. 
All the animals affected are expected to recover. 
“Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,” said a Wildlife Conservation Society statement. “It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.” 
The zoo was shuttered to the public on March 16, while the first animal began displaying symptoms on March 27. 
This positive test brings up new questions/concerns about how the virus spreads amongst animals. Up until this moment, the USDA says they weren't aware of any cases of pets or livestock catching the virus in America. Dr. Jane Rooney, a vet/USDA official quoted by the AP News, says that “It’s important to assure pet owners and animal owners that at this time there isn’t any evidence that they can spread the virus.”
A few reports have circulated of pets getting the virus from their contagious owners. One of these reports included a dog in Hong Kong who had acquired a low level of the pathogen around the end of February. The dog eventually died. Agriculture authorities in that region came to the conclusion that dogs and cats could test positive if their owners gave it to them, but that they couldn't pass the virus to humans."

A New Mexico man tried to set his disabled wife on fire because he was angry he didn’t qualify for a coronavirus-related stimulus check, police alleged.
Cops arrested, Joe Macias, 63, this past Wednesday after he got into an argument with his wife and allegedly doused her with gasoline, the Albuquerque Journal reported.

      Joe Macias was charged with attempted murder, kidnapping and aggravated battery against a household member.
      (MDC)


The wife told police that Macias had come home around 5 p.m. with a four-pack of beer, “upset because he did not qualify for the stimulus check.”
Macias threw gas on his wife and their mobile home, police said.
The wife told officers Macias pulled out a cigarette and tried to light it several times but was unsuccessful because gasoline got on the lighter.
Police said officers later found Macias walking down the street wearing gasoline-soaked clothes. Officers also discovered the woman, with her hair and pajamas soaked in gasoline, on the floor inside a nearby trailer.

                Esper defends firing of Navy ship captain over virus warning

                
                
                
                    
                

            

        

    



                                    

                                
                                                
                        
            WASHINGTON (AP) — With the military under broad pressure to step up its coronavirus response, Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Sunday defended the firing of an aircraft carrier commander who sought help for sailors during an outbreak as a matter of holding leaders “accountable.” He also said the matter was under review.


    
            In two television interviews, Esper said acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly made a “very tough decision” last Thursday to oust Capt. Brett Crozier of command of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, which was docked in Guam, and that he supported the decision.


    
                                            
                    
            “It was based on his view that he had lost faith and confidence in the captain, based on his actions. It was supported by Navy leadership,” Esper said.


    
            Still, the Pentagon chief declined to explicitly say he agreed with Modly’s assessment, noting that there is “an investigation ongoing.”


    
                                
                    
            
                                

            
            “This could ultimately come to my desk,” he said. “I think Secretary Modly laid out very reasonably, very deliberately the reasons why. And I think, when all those facts come to bear, we will have a chance to understand why Secretary Modly did what he did.”


    
                                
                    
            
            Crozier circulated a memo to Navy leaders last week that was obtained by news media in which he urged speedy action to evacuate the ship of nearly 5,000 sailors as the coronavirus began to escalate. Modly said Crozier “demonstrated extremely poor judgment” in the middle of a crisis, although Navy officials later announced they would offload 2,700 sailors in the coming days.


    
                                
                    
            
            Videos went viral on social media over the weekend, showing hundreds of sailors gathered on the ship chanting and applauding Crozier on Thursday as he walked off the vessel, turned, saluted, waved and got into a waiting car.


    
            His firing comes amid pressure on the military as it seeks to step up its response to the coronavirus outbreak, including sending two Navy hospital ships to assist New York and Los Angeles. On Sunday, Esper said the Pentagon was sending over 1,100 additional doctors, nurses and other medical staff to New York as part of a COVID-19 operation that would have the military in charge of “the largest hospital in the United States,” with 2,500 beds at the city's Jacob Javits Convention Center.


    
                                

            
            Esper issued new requirements for those visiting or working on Department of Defense installations regarding the use of cloth face coverings. He said that “to the extent practical,” all individuals on department property “will wear” the coverings when they cannot maintain six feet of social distance from others. The guidance, outlined in a memo to senior military leaders Sunday, is effective immediately.


    
            As the coronavirus pandemic worsens and the country turns increasingly to the military for help, America’s armed services have been struggling to get new recruits as families and communities hunker down. The services, as a result, could fall thousands short of their enlistment goals if the widespread lockdowns drag on, forcing them to pressure current troops to stay on in order to maintain broader military readiness.


    
            Asked over the weekend about whether Crozier's firing could hurt morale in the military, President Donald Trump said he was not involved with the decision but agreed with it “100 percent.""


    
            “I thought it was terrible what he did to write a letter,” he told reporters Saturday. “I mean, this isn’t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that’s nuclear powered. And he shouldn’t be talking that way in a letter. He could call and ask and suggest.”


    
            Esper insisted it was not unusual for the Navy to relieve commanders so quickly without first completing a review into their actions. But he also declined to say what will happen to Crozier, citing the current ongoing investigation. Esper said he backed Modly's decision after also receiving advice from the chief of naval operations and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.


    
            ""It's just another example of how we hold leaders accountable for their actions,"" Esper said.


    
            He said over half of the ship had now been tested. About 155 sailors had tested positive for COVID-19, exhibiting “mild and moderate” symptoms with “no hospitalizations whatsoever.”


    
            For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.


    
            Esper said not all the sailors will be evacuated because the ship has sensitive equipment and weapons on board, and a new commander will be arriving there soon to assess the crew's safety.


    
            The ouster has drawn fire from different quarters, including former military commanders.


    
            On Sunday, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called the Trump administration's handling of the case as “close to criminal.”


    
            “The idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his Navy personnel were in danger,” he said. “I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.”


    
            Tweed Roosevelt, the great grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt, called Crozier a “hero.”


    
            “In this era when so many seem to place expediency over honor, it is heartening that so many others are showing great courage, some even risking their lives. Theodore Roosevelt, in his time, chose the honorable course,” Tweed Roosevelt wrote in an op-ed Friday in The New York Times. “Captain Crozier has done the same.”


    
            Esper appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and ABC’s “This Week,” and Biden also was on ABC."

Following a series of leaks over the weekend, Mother Monster debuted the Chromatica album cover on Sunday, rolling out artwork for the digital, vinyl, and cassette versions (all of which have the track listing blurred out).

The cover sees Gaga — dressed in a leather corset while sporting pink hair — laying on her back atop a grate radiating rose-colored light, with a sea of black cables, decaying foliage, and broken metal ensnaring the lower half of her body. Her midsection is also connected to the Chromatica logo — a yin-yang-inspired symbol that has come to represent the album's titular planet/headspace/otherworldly state of mind.

""I think what I've learned is that I can view the world in whatever way I choose to see it, and it, it doesn't mean that I'm deleting the bad things, it just means that I can reframe my life experiences and reframe also the way that the world frames life experiences to a way that I love and believe in, and that's, that is Chromatica,"" Gaga recently said of the album's inspiration, which includes embracing past trauma and celebrating life's pains and pleasures on an album reportedly filled with emotionally charged dance-pop bangers.  ""I went into my frame, I found earth, I deleted it. Earth is canceled. I live on Chromatica.”

Gaga initially announced that the album — which she revealed includes a secret duetwith another major female pop star, rumored to be Ariana Grande — would release on April 10, though the global coronavirus pandemic forced her to postpone the studio set's release until later this year, though an exact date hasn't been confirmed.

The album's release was preceded by the announcement of the accompanying Chromatica Ball world tour and the lead single ""Stupid Love,"" the music video for which features Gaga leading various factions of alienesque residents as they battled for dominance on a fantastical planet.

""The reason I love working with her is you don’t know where you’re going next. Nobody knows what genre we’re going to take,"" Gaga's longtime choreographer Richy Jackson previously told EW about working with her on the ""Stupid Love"" music video.

This is the first known instance of a tiger being infected with the virus.

Nadia, a 4-year-old Malayan tiger, was tested after she developed a dry cough and had a decrease in appetite, according to a news release from the Bronx Zoo. The test was confirmed by the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory, based in Ames, Iowa.

""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement.

Three other tigers and three African lions also exhibited similar symptoms, the zoo said. All of the cats, including Nadia, are expected to make full recoveries.

""Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,"" the zoo said. ""It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.""

The USDA said in a news release that public health officials believe the cats became sick after they were exposed to an asymptomatic zoo employee. The zoo has been closed to the public since March 16 and the first tiger started to show signs of illness on March 27.

There is still a lot that public health experts do not understand about the coronavirus. The USDA recommends that people sick with COVID-19 restrict their contact with pets out of an abundance of caution.

""Although there have not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19 in the United States, it is still recommended that people sick with COVID-19 limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus,"" the USDA said in a statement. ""If a sick person must care for a pet or be around animals, they should wash their hands before and after the interaction."""

But then they heard sirens on their street, so they raced outside and were greeted with something that made their birthday unforgettable.

As Jaxon, Croix and their parents stood in front of their home in Osseo, Wisconsin, a parade of four firetrucks, two ambulances and two police cars flashed their lights and sounded their sirens as they drove by. One fireman got out of his truck to drop off some plastic firefighter hats and stickers.

For Jaxon, who has always loved firetrucks and police cars, the personal parade was more than he could ever ask for.

""It made it the best birthday ever,"" Jaxon told CNN.

Jaxon's mother, Hailey, knew it was coming because she was the one who made the request. She messaged the Osseo Rural Fire Department on Facebook after seeing the department's post offering the birthday ""drive-by"" service.

Jaxon's birthday was in March and Croix's was this month, but they've had to stay at home amid the pandemic. ""We weren't expecting it to be as great as it was,"" Hailey said. ""We just thought maybe they'd drive one firetruck by, but we got out there and there were all of the firetrucks, the Osseo Police Department and Trempealeau County Sheriff's Department, the Mayo Clinic ambulances. It just brought tears to your eyes."" The fire department's EMS captain, Kirk Gunderson, created the idea and said he's already received five more requests. ""When I reached out to the police, Mayo Clinic ambulances, they said they were all in. There wasn't a moment of hesitation,"" Gunderson said. ""It goes with the nature of emergency responders -- to be there in time of need for someone else. Sure, we're not spraying water, but we're helping them in another way."" Gunderson said they hope to keep this going until the statewide stay-at-home order is lifted. ""We as emergency responders often see people in the worst time of their days,"" Gunderson said. ""But now, putting a smile in their day helps to put a smile in ours."""

U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Sunday that the impending onslaught of coronavirus cases and deaths will rival some of America's most trying times in modern history, telling the country to prepare for widespread tragedy comparable to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

""This is going to be the hardest and the saddest week of most Americans' lives, quite frankly,"" Adams said on Fox News Sunday. ""This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it's not going to be localized. It's going to be happening all over the country. And I want America to understand that.""

Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said ""this is going to be a bad week,"" speaking on CBS' Face the Nation, saying the next week is ""going to be shocking to some, but that's what is going to happen before it turns around.""

The White House's coronavirus task force did not have a briefing scheduled on Sunday, but one was added at the last minute. It's slated to begin at 7 p.m. ET.

The dire predictions come amid a toll exacted by the virus that is already grim.

Confirmed coronavirus infections in America have passed 330,000 and killed in excess of 9,400 people, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University show.

The White House's coronavirus task force has said it expects at least 100,000 U.S. deaths from the virus in the coming weeks and months.

New York has been the epicenter of the country's epidemic, but prediction models show Detroit and New Orleans should also be bracing for an especially significant crush of new cases soon.

Most of the country is on lockdown and the economy has nearly skidded to a stop, prompting a record 10 million people to file for unemployment over two weeks.

Scores of major events are being postponed or cancelled. And Sunday, former Vice President Joe Biden suggested his party's presidential nominating convention, which had already been delayed a month over coronavirus fears, could be forced to happen virtually."

*This story originally appeared in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-pandemic-leading-to-huge-drop-in-air-pollution) and is part of the [Climate Desk](https://www.climatedesk.org/) collaboration.*

The coronavirus pandemic is shutting down industrial activity and temporarily slashing air pollution levels around the world, satellite imagery from the European Space Agency shows.

One expert said the sudden shift represented the “largest-scale experiment ever,” in terms of the reduction of industrial emissions.

Readings from ESA’s Sentinel-5P satellite show that over the past six weeks, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO~2~) over cities and industrial clusters in Asia and Europe were markedly lower than in the same period last year.

Nitrogen dioxide is produced from car engines, power plants and other industrial processes and is thought to exacerbate respiratory illnesses such as asthma.



[#image: /photos/5e7e29fc8283f9000a4151a0]

While not a greenhouse gas itself, the pollutant originates from the same activities and industrial sectors that are responsible for a large share of the world’s carbon emissions and that drive global heating.

Paul Monks, professor of air pollution at the University of Leicester, predicted there will be important lessons to learn. “We are now, inadvertently, conducting the largest-scale experiment ever seen,” he said. “Are we looking at what we might see in the future if we can move to a low-carbon economy? Not to denigrate the loss of life, but this might give us some hope from something terrible. To see what can be achieved.”

Monks, the former chair of the UK government’s science advisory committee on air quality, said that a reduction in air pollution could bring some health benefits, though they were unlikely to offset loss of life from the disease.

“It seems entirely probable that a reduction in air pollution will be beneficial to people in susceptible categories, for example some asthma sufferers,” he said. “It could reduce the spread of disease. A high level of air pollution exacerbates viral uptake because it inflames and lowers immunity.” Agriculture could also get a boost because pollution stunts plant growth, he added.

The World Health Organization describes NO ~2~ as “a toxic gas which causes significant inflammation of the airways” at concentrations above 200 micrograms per cubic meter. Pollution particles may also be a vector for pathogens, as well as exacerbating existing health problems. The WHO is now investigating whether airborne pollution particles may be a vector that spreads Covid-19 and makes it more virulent.

One of the largest drops in pollution levels could be seen over the city of Wuhan, in central China, which was put under a strict lockdown in late January. The city of 11 million people serves as a major transportation hub and is home to hundreds of factories supplying car parts and other hardware to global supply chains. According to NASA, nitrogen dioxide levels across eastern and central China have been 10 to 30 percent lower than normal.

NO~2~ levels also dropped in South Korea, which has long struggled with high emissions from its large fleet of coal-fired power plants but also from nearby industrial facilities in China.

The country has avoided putting entire regions under lockdown but is meticulously tracing and isolating suspected coronavirus cases.

The changes over northern Italy are particularly striking because smoke from a dense cluster of factories tends to get trapped against the Alps at the end of the Po Valley, making this one of western Europe’s pollution hot spots.

Since the country went into lockdown on March 9, NO~2~ levels in Milan and other parts of northern Italy have fallen by about 40 percent. “It’s quite unprecedented,” said Vincent-Henri Peuch, director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Service. “In the past, we have seen big variations for a day or so because of weather. But no signal on emissions that has lasted so long.”



[#image: /photos/5e7e29fea231050008135fb1]

The source is not yet clear. One possibility is a slowdown of activity in Italy’s industrial heartland. Another factor is likely to be a reduction in road traffic, which accounts for the biggest share of nitrogen dioxide emissions in Europe.

Peuch said satellites were now starting to pick up similar signals in other European cities that are entering into lockdowns, though the data needs to studied over over a longer period to confirm this is a pattern.

Although the UK is more than a week behind Italy in terms of the spread of the disease and the government’s response, roadside monitors already show significantly reduced levels of pollution at hot spots such as Marylebone in London.

Road traffic accounts for about 80 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions in the UK, according to Monk. For the average diesel car, each kilometer not driven avoids 52 milligrams of the pollutant entering the air.

“What I think will come out of this is a realization—because we are forced to—that there is considerable potential to change working practices and lifestyles. This challenges us in the future to think, do we really need to drive our car there or burn fuel for that,” said Monk.

Three more tigers and three lions have developed a dry cough and are suspected cases. It is the first known confirmed case of COVID-19 in a tiger.

""Nadia, a 4-year-old female Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo, has tested positive for COVID-19"" the statement reads. ""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus.""

The test was confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The cats were infected by a carer who was not displaying any symptoms of the disease, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.

Six other big cats -- three tigers and three lions -- housed at the Bronx Zoo are also displaying symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The cats have experienced ""some decrease in appetite"" but remain ""bright, alert and interactive"" with their keepers. They are expected to make a full recovery.

New York is the worst hit state in the US and has recorded over 2,200 deaths.

Coronaviruses, including the one which causes COVID-19, can make their homes in a variety of species, from camels to cows and pigs. The coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which was first detected in China in December 2019, is suspected to have originated in bats, before making the jump to an intermediary animal and then finding its way into humans. It has also been detected in cats and dogs.

A pre-print study, yet to be peer-reviewed and published on bioRxiv on April 1, suggests cats can infect each other with SARS-CoV-2, acting as a reservoir for the disease. Even so, experts caution there is no need to panic about our pets.

""There is very, very scant evidence that companion animals can become infected,"" says Trevor Drew, director of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. The CDC reiterates this notion but suggests further studies are needed to understand how animals may be affected by COVID-19."

(NYSE: WORK) is integrating with competitor Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) Teams to let users make cross-platform calls.
What Happened
""We're working on Teams integrations for calling features,"" the workplace communications company's chief executive officer Stewart Butterfield told RBC analyst Alex Zukin on a call, as reported by CNBC.
The feature would allow Slack users to be able to directly call users of Teams, without needing to leave its platform.
It's not immediately clear when the integration will happen.
Slack already has other Microsoft products integrated with its platform, including Outlook, OneDrive, and SharePoint, as noted earlier by CNBC.
The move comes as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has caused a remote work boom.
The demand for telecommunication services has increased, including for other companies like Zoom Video Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ZM) and Cisco Systems Inc.'s (NASDAQ: CSCO) Webex.
Slack's simultaneously connected users jumped 20% between March 16 and March 25 at 12.5 million. Microsoft earlier reported that Teams added 12 million daily active users between March 11 and March 18.
Teams was launched two years after Slack in 2016 but has overtaken it in terms of daily active users, especially due to its popularity with big firms, as a CNBC survey found last year.
Price Action
Slack's shares closed 10.05% higher at $28.48 on Thursday and added another 0.56% at $28.64 in the after-hours session.
Microsoft stock closed 6.26% higher at $156.11 per share. The shares traded slightly lower at $155.69 in the after-hours session.

This weekend has seen a particularly deadly toll in the county, with 38 deaths reported Saturday, the largest one-day total yet. “We have some very difficult days ahead and now is the time for all of us to redouble our physical distancing efforts and look after our neighbors, friends, and families who may be at the highest risk for serious illness from COVID-19,” Barbara Ferrer, director of the L.A. County Department of Public Health, said in a statement. Of the fatalities reported Sunday, 10 of those who died were older than 65, and 11 had underlying health conditions, officials said. One person was under the age of 40. Two of the deaths already had been reported by the city of Pasadena, which has its own health department. There have now been nearly 1,400 coronavirus infections recorded in L.A. County over the last 48 hours as the number of people tested has risen to 31,000. Long Beach officials also reported 15 new cases Sunday, for a total of 213. Concerned about the rise of coronavirus infections, Riverside County has taken the unprecedented step of ordering all residents to cover their faces when leaving home, marking a dramatic escalation by county officials in their attempts to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Despite previous pleas from county officials for residents to practice social distancing, cover their faces and stay home, “more and more” residents are getting infected with the virus, and “not everyone’s getting the message,” said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, Riverside County health officer, on Saturday in issuing the order. “We change from saying that you should to saying that you must,” Kaiser said in a prepared statement published by the county. As of Saturday, Riverside County had reported 665 confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection, while 18 people had died from COVID-19, officials said. Los Angeles and the Bay Area have urged residents to cover their mouths and noses, and San Diego County on Saturday ordered all essential workers to do the same, part of a broader effort among local governments and the state to flatten the curve of the pandemic before hospitals become overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients. But Riverside County’s new mandate is far more strict, requiring anyone who leaves the house to cover up. The order also bans all gatherings of people except for family members residing in the same home, according to the county’s news release. The sharply worded news release said police officers had the power to enforce the orders “as they deem necessary.” “We have already lost two of our deputies to this virus. I am asking all of you to honor them by staying at home,” said Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco. Surgeon General Jerome Adams on Sunday also urged Americans to follow social-distancing guidelines and to wear face coverings in public to help slow the spread of the sometimes deadly virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week called on Americans to wear masks when venturing out, but President Trump said Friday: “I don’t see it for myself.” “The president is making a choice that is appropriate for him,” said the surgeon general on “Fox News Sunday.” Adams has released a video showing how to make a simple homemade face covering with fabric and rubber bands. Wearing a mask, he cautioned, is not a substitute for social distancing. Adams also deflected questions about the need for a nationwide stay-at-home order. Trump has said he prefers to leave the decision to governors, nine of whom have not issued such a directive in their states. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, said Sunday that states that did not take such measures harmed the overall effort to stem the outbreak. “It isn’t that they’re putting the rest of the country at risk as much as they’re putting themselves at risk,” he said in an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “Every time I get to that podium in the White House briefing room, I plead with people to take a look at those very simple guidelines of physical separation.” Fauci said last week he did not understand why there was not a nationwide stay-at-home order in place. Adams said in the Fox interview that the federal government’s guidelines, which are voluntary, were “essentially” a national order. “Over 90% of the country is staying home,” he said. Both officials warned of difficult times ahead. Adams said the coming week was going to be “the hardest and saddest of most Americans’ lives,” likening the projected toll of COVID-19 to “our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment.” More than 310,000 cases of the coronavirus illness have been reported nationwide, and the death toll is nearing 8,500. There are preliminary signs that stay-at-home directives and social distancing have been effective, Fauci said, but “we’re still not at that apex.” “Within a week, eight, nine days or so, we’re hopefully going to see that turning around,” he said. Coronavirus-related deaths across California have soared past 300, with Los Angeles County on Saturday reporting its largest single-day rise in fatalities as officials worked to improve testing and keep people at home. Orange County reported 49 additional coronavirus cases Sunday, for a total of 834 cases, including 14 deaths. Of those diagnosed, 137 were hospitalized and 56 were in intensive care units, officials said. The cases include two Orange County Sheriff's deputies who tested positive for the virus earlier in the week, Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Carrie Braun said Sunday. One works at the Theo Lacy jail in Orange and the other at the Men’s Central Jail in Santa Ana, where at least one inmate also has tested positive. Both deputies were resting at home, Braun said. In a move aimed at reducing the jail population to limit the spread of the coronavirus, California judicial leaders are set to meet remotely Monday, where they're expected to adopt a statewide emergency order setting bail at zero for misdemeanor and lower-level felony offenses. The Judicial Council, the policymaking body for California’s court system, also is expected to vote to suspend evictions and foreclosures and to allow for the expansion of court hearings held by video or telephone. Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye heads the council, which is primarily made up of judges. Gov. Gavin Newsom has given her and the council extraordinary temporary powers to suspend laws to deal with the health crisis. California has recorded more than 13,000 cases overall, and officials believe those numbers will sharply rise as testing continues to expand. In a Saturday news conference, Newsom said California would significantly increase coronavirus testing capabilities, adding that he was responsible for testing lapses in the state that had made it difficult to track the virus. Newsom announced a task force that he said would work toward a fivefold increase in daily testing in the state by identifying supply shortages and adding testing locations. “We are now in a position where I can confidently say it’s a new day,” he said. The announcement comes as California continues to see dramatic increases in people hospitalized with the virus, with 2,398 patients in the state. An additional 3,187 people hospitalized are suspected of having COVID-19 but are awaiting test results. From Friday night to Saturday morning, the number of coronavirus patients in California’s ICU beds rose nearly 11% to 1,008 people. By Sunday, that number had inched up to 1,040. In all, Newsom said Saturday that 126,700 people had been tested in California, a state of about 40 million people. Of those who have been tested, 13,000 are awaiting results. “The testing space has been a challenging one for us, and I own that,” he said. “And I have a responsibility as your governor to do better and do more testing in the state.” Public health experts have said widespread testing is crucial to the state’s efforts to accurately assess how many people are infected and where the virus is spreading. Newsom said he was confident the newly announced task force, made up of private and public leaders, would deal with testing challenges in the state. He said the state was partnering with universities, hospitals, labs and testing companies to increase testing locations across the state, reduce backlogs and ensure there were more accurate and timely data on the number of COVID-19 cases. The task force will be led by Paul Markovich, president and chief executive of Blue Shield of California, and Dr. Charity Dean, assistant director of the California Department of Public Health. State officials have been working to add more hospital and ICU beds to handle the expected surge in coronavirus patients. The state’s modeling suggests California will need 50,000 new hospital beds by mid-May. To meet that demand, the state is asking for recently retired medical providers, those with licenses from other states and medical school students to join the newly created California Health Corps. Newsom said that a “staggering number of individuals” — some 79,000 people — had signed up through the state’s Health Corps website. Meanwhile, a crackdown on coronavirus-order scofflaws has escalated in recent days, with nonessential businesses that refuse to shut down, as well as people who defy orders to stay out of the water, finding themselves in the crosshairs. Los Angeles prosecutors on Friday filed criminal charges against two smoke shops, a shoe store and a discount electronics retailer, accusing them of refusing to shut down despite orders. It marked the first time the city had filed charges for violations of the “Safer at Home” order, which requires businesses deemed nonessential to close their doors to slow the spread of the coronavirus. City Atty. Mike Feuer on Friday said the four stores were deemed nonessential businesses under Mayor Eric Garcetti’s executive order. Garcetti said the stores were putting lives at risk. At one store, police officers were told, “ ‘Forget you’ — probably not in as nice words — ‘We’re not going to do it,’ ” the mayor said. That comes as workers at some businesses deemed essential are calling for their employers to grant them more protections against the virus. Cooks and cashiers protested from their cars outside a McDonald’s on Crenshaw Boulevard on Sunday after they say a coworker tested positive for the virus, prompting the store to close for a day. The workers said they were going on strike until the company agreed to provide a two-week paid quarantine and to cover healthcare costs of any worker or immediate family member who becomes ill with COVID-19. The owner-operator of the McDonald's, Nicole Enearu, said Sunday in a statement that the restaurant was closed and sanitized as soon as managers were notified that an employee had tested positive, and that all other staff who had been in close contact with the employee had been asked to self-quarantine for 14 days. ""We are committed to paying both the infected employee and the other employees who need to quarantine,"" she said. In Orange County, a plan to house homeless people with the coronavirus in a hotel near a gated retirement community has sparked outrage among some of its neighbors. Orange County officials recently entered into an agreement to use two boutique Ayres hotels as temporary housing for those without shelter amid the pandemic. One hotel is just outside Laguna Woods Village, a community with thousands of residents older than 55. County officials say they have few options as they try to quickly move people indoors amid fears that an outbreak among the homeless population could further strain health systems. They say the facility will be locked down, with patients unable to have visitors or leave freely. Residents of the retirement community, where the average age is about 78, say they fear having homeless patients or the staff who care for the sick nearby because residents are at high risk of death from the virus. On Saturday afternoon, dozens of residents gathered outside the hotel, at times shouting, “Don’t kill us,” while others circled nearby in their cars, honking their horns. Laguna Woods city officials have said they are deeply concerned by the county’s decision and are exploring legal action. Wigglesworth and Elmahrek reported from Los Angeles, Gutierrez reported from Sacramento, King reported from Washington and Dolan reported from San Francisco.

“I think Acting [Navy] Secretary [Thomas] Modly made a very tough decision — a decision that I support. It was based on his view that he had lost faith and confidence in the captain based on his actions,” Esper told CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday on State of the Union. “It was supported by Navy leadership. It’s just another example of how we hold leaders accountable for their actions.”

Esper’s defense of the firing last week represents a doubling down on a decision that has received criticism from national security experts and former top military officials as a potentially politicized overreaction that could discourage other military leaders from speaking candidly about what’s needed to contain coronavirus outbreaks at military outposts, at a critical moment for global national security.

When Tapper asked if it was appropriate to relieve Capt. Brett Crozier of his command before completing an investigation into his conduct, Esper said that it was not abnormal to do so. 

“All the services at times relieve commanders without the benefit of an investigation up front because they have lost confidence in them. It’s certainly not unique to the Navy. The Navy has a culture of swiftly and decisively removing captains if they lose confidence in them,” Esper said.

Crozier, who has reportedly tested positive for Covid-19, wrote in his letter that the Navy needed to get more sailors off the carrier swiftly to protect their health amid an outbreak spreading aboard the ship. “We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,” he wrote. 

President Donald Trump said during a press briefing on Saturday that the letter “looked terrible” and was “not appropriate.” He also said that he personally “didn’t make the decision.” 

But the Washington Post reports that Modly told a colleague the day before Crozier was removed from his post: “Breaking news: Trump wants him fired.” 

What happened on the USS Theodore Roosevelt

Crozier sent the four-page letter to Navy officials on March 30 because he was dissatisfied with the measures the service took to protect his sailors after they started testing positive for Covid-19 on the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier under his command. 

After three sailors were medically evacuated from the carrier, which has a crew of nearly 5,000, Crozier wrote the missive that called for the Navy to act more aggressively. He asked for 90 percent of the crew to be removed so that they could be tested and quarantined properly, and so the ship could be disinfected. CNN’s Ryan Browne reports this process is now underway — half of the ship’s crew have been tested (with 155 confirmed cases as of April 5) and nearly 2,000 sailors have been taken off the carrier.

In his letter, Crozier argued for such measures because he felt there was inadequate space aboard for social distancing, and that the spread of the disease was “accelerating” despite earlier evacuations.

“[W]e are not at war, and therefore cannot allow a single Sailor to perish as a result of this pandemic unnecessarily,” Crozier wrote. “Decisive action is required now in order to comply with CDC and (Navy) guidance and prevent tragic outcomes.”

Crozier sent the message via an unclassified email to Navy officials, copying around 20 or 30 individuals. It’s unclear who exactly was copied on the email, but eventually the letter was leaked and appeared in the San Francisco Chronicle.

Initially it looked like Crozier might not be punished or fired. Statements from Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday and Modly suggested they were unhappy about the leak, but that Crozier would keep his command.

“I don’t know who leaked the letter to the media — that would be something that would violate the principles of good order if he were responsible for that, but I don’t know that,” Modly said on Wednesday. “The fact that he wrote the letter of his to his chain of command to express his concerns would absolutely not result in any type of retaliation.”

He also said that the letter was something “we want our commanding officers to be able to do.”

But the next day, Modly said that Crozier had shown “poor judgment” by sending his letter through email which was not secure to up to 30 people, and that his immediate superior on the ship was not among them.

“I could reach no other conclusion than that Capt. Crozier had allowed the complexity of his challenge with the Covid outbreak on his ship to overwhelm his ability to act professionally, when acting professionally was what was needed most at the time,” Modly told reporters on Thursday. 

It’s unclear if Trump’s reported desire for Crozier to be fired influenced decision making for Modly, who is a political appointee. It is certainly possible that Modly’s overall assessment of the propriety of the situation was incomplete when he initially spoke to reporters.  

However the decision was arrived at, when Crozier was dismissed, sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt gave him a raucous-send off with cheers and singing to show their appreciation of his efforts on their behalf.






Should Crozier have been dismissed?

Modly’s argument for relieving Crozier of his command is that he violated the chain of command and didn’t abide by security protocols when communicating his grievances. 

It’s also possible that Trump — who has routinely fired people in the federal government whom he perceives as disloyal and has intervened in the military’s justice system in a manner that’s highly unusual for presidents — could have played some role behind the scenes.

When the president spoke on Saturday, he implied it might be Crozier’s fault that Covid-19 broke out on the ship after it stopped over in Vietnam, even though the stop was pre-scheduled by the regional command.

“I guess the captain stopped in Vietnam and people got off in Vietnam,” Trump said. “Perhaps you don’t do that in the middle of a pandemic or — or something that looked like it was going to be — you know, history would say you don’t necessarily stop and let your sailors get off.”

Trump also excoriated the letter as inappropriate. “I thought it was terrible what he did to write a letter. I mean, this isn’t a class on literature,” he said.

But many experts, former military officials, and top Democrats disagree with Trump’s criticisms of Crozier. 

According to the Washington Post, half a dozen former top Navy officials said in interviews that “Modly’s intervention was a mistake that they feared would have a chilling effect on commanders and encourage them to suppress bad news that might upset political leaders.”

“I think the firing was a really bad decision, because it undermines the authority of the military commanders who are trying to take care of their troops, and significantly negatively impacts the willingness of commanders to speak truth to power,” retired Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Post.

John Kirby, a retired rear admiral in the US Navy and security analyst for CNN, wrote that Crozier is “guilty of a process foul” in the way he failed to send out his letter over a secure network and didn’t include his immediate boss. But Kirby argued that he ultimately doesn’t consider these errors sufficient cause for being dismissed from a post.

“[W]e’ve seen no evidence that others in Crozier’s chain of command were similarly bypassed or even surprised by its contents,” Kirby wrote in his analysis for CNN. “We’ve seen no evidence that he sent a “blast-out email” to everyone he knows. And we’ve seen no public evidence that Crozier leaked the email to the media or was even aware that it had been provided to the San Francisco Chronicle.”

“We’ve seen none of this evidence, because either Modly would not share those details or because he does not possess them,” Kirby added.

Kirby argues it would’ve been more fair to let an investigation take place before taking action, and that declining to do so is both a distraction for sailors and “sends a horrible message to other commanding officers about the degree to which they can be candid about their efforts to stop the spread of coronavirus in their units.”

Top Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee agree, and released a joint statement arguing that Crozier’s chain of command offense didn’t merit a move that suggests instability or insecurity in the armed forces.  

“While Captain Crozier clearly went outside the chain of command, his dismissal at this critical moment – as the sailors aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt are confronted with the COVID-19 pandemic – is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet’s readiness,” the committee’s Democratic leadership said in a statement. “Captain Crozier was justifiably concerned about the health and safety of his crew, but he did not handle the immense pressure appropriately. However, relieving him of his command is an overreaction.”

And Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was even more frank about the matter.

“I think it’s close to criminal the way they’re dealing with this guy,” he said on ABC’s This Week on Sunday, “I think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.”"

The Oregon Health Authority announced one new death Sunday afternoon: a 62-year-old Multnomah County woman tested positive on April 2 and died the same day in her residence. According to OHA, it’s unknown if she had underlying health conditions.

OHA identified 69 newly diagnosed cases across 12 counties, including the first presumptive positive case in Sherman County.

Josephine and Lane Counties also reported new cases following OHA’s report Sunday.

Additionally, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs announced another death Saturday evening — a resident at the Lebanon veterans’ home. The home has reported 18 positive cases and three deaths related to COVID-19.

The state now has 28 known deaths from the virus.

Washington sends excess ventilators to states in need

Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Sunday that the state plans to return more than 400 ventilators it received from the Strategic National Stockpile, so they can go to hard-hit states like New York. 

Washington expects to receive in the coming weeks 750 more ventilators it recently purchased.

According to Dr. Raquel Bono, Washington’s leader of COVID-19 response efforts, the state has fewer infections than anticipated, allowing it to help other states that have more immediate needs.

Oregon sends 140 ventilators to New York

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday that New York will receive 1,000 ventilators from China and 140 ventilators from Oregon. 

“It’s going to make a significant difference for us,” Cuomo said. 

Cuomo had said Thursday that the state would exhaust its stock of ventilators within a week if the number of critically ill patients with coronavirus continued to grow at the same rate. 

“New York needs more ventilators, and we are answering their call for help,” Gov. Kate Brown tweeted Saturday morning. “Oregon is in a better position right now. We must all do that we can to help those on the front lines of this response.”

“Oregon doesn’t have everything we need to fight COVID-19 — we need more PPE and testing — but we can help today with ventilators. We are all in this together,” she tweeted, referring to personal protective equipment by an acronym.

Oregon received 140 ventilators from the Federal Emergency Management Agency at the end of March.

In a media briefing Thursday, state health officer Dr. Dean Sidelinger said current modeling shows that staying home is working, likely cutting down infections by 50% to 70% in Oregon. Sidelinger said that avoiding a big spike in Oregon cases depends on people following Brown’s stay-home order and health care workers having adequate personal protective equipment.

310 people have died with COVID-19 in Washington

The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Clark County was 137 as of Friday night, and eight people are known to have died from COVID-19, according to public health officials. Clark County Public Health announced six new positive cases Friday and no additional known deaths.

Washington had 7,591 diagnosed cases of the coronavirus and 310 related deaths as of Friday night, according to the Washington Department of Health."

""We're going to continue to see an escalation, also we should hope that within a week, maybe a little bit more, we'll start to see a flattening of the curve and coming down,"" Fauci told CBS Face the Nation host Margaret Brennan on Sunday. ""The mitigation ... is absolutely key to the success of that. So, on the one hand, things are going to get bad and we need to be prepared for that, things are going to be shocking to some. It certainly is really disturbing to see that.""

""We just buckle down, continue to mitigate, continue to do the physical separation, because we gotta get through the week that's coming up, because it is going to be a bad week,"" he continued.

Brennen asked the doctor if he's saying that ""despite the deaths that we may see, that mitigation is working and you do have this outbreak under control?""

""I will not say we have it under control Margaret,"" Fauci responded, ""that'd be a false statement. We are struggling to get it under control and that's the issue that's at hand right now.""

""We need to be clear that even though mitigation is working, we're still going to see that tail off of deaths,"" he continued. ""The first thing we want to look for is to see on a daily basis a number of new cases start to stabilize.""

""We've seen that in Italy,"" Fauci added. ""We're going to hopefully see that in New York very soon, and that's the first sign of that plateau coming down.""

Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.

On Sunday afternoon, the U.S. had confirmed more than 330,000 positive cases of the coronavirus, with over 21,000 new infections being added in the past 24 hours. The total number of domestic deaths caused by the novel virus climbed 1,089 to 9,540.

Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, estimated last week that between 100,000 to 240,000 individuals are expected to die domestically from the virus, even with social distancing measures in place. If the strict policies were not implemented, the death toll could sit anywhere between 1 million to 2.2 million, they said.

The CDC has recommended that the American public begin wearing face coverings in public settings to limit the spread of the virus, but President Donald Trump on Friday said that he will not be wearing one because his job requires him to meet various people.

""I just don't want to wear one myself,"" the president told reporters. ""It's a recommendation, they recommend it. I'm feeling good.""

""Somehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful resolute desk, the great resolute desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don't know,"" he added. ""Somehow, I don't see it for myself. I just don't.""

Fauci on Sunday said he does wear a mask in public spaces. ""If I go out which I really don't do very much because of my life as it is now, I would and do,"" he explained. ""If you have a situation where you don't have control over that six foot distance, you wear a mask.""

          On Sunday night in Great Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to the hospital for additional testing after suffering from coronavirus symptoms. A Downing Street spokesperson said that his hospitalization was a “precautionary step,” as Johnson still has symptoms ten days after testing positive for the virus.

        
          Johnson, the first world leader to test positive for COVID-19, is expected to stay overnight for “routine tests,” according to the BBC. He will remain in charge of the government, though Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will lead a coronavirus meeting on Monday morning.

        
          
        
          
        
          On Sunday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the U.K. could face a nationwide lockdown if the public did not take seriously the current guidelines for social distancing. Though the U.K. currently has the world’s eighth-worst outbreak — with over 48,000 confirmed cases and 4,900 deaths — the peak of the crisis is expected to hit in seven to ten days. If modeling of the crisis is correct, public-health advisers have also suggested that social distancing measures could be relaxed by the end of May.

Defending workers is now life-and-death: What essential employees need in the coronavirus crisis,2020-04-05 22:13:38+00:00,http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-defending-workers-is-now-life-and-death-20200406-voxxmtrb6zgodl6tekotbmy4ba-story.html,[],602,0,"['essential', 'employees', 'life-and-death', 'coronavirus', 'crisis', 'workers', 'frontline workers', 'Construction Fraud', 'employer', 'safety', 'companies', 'fraud', 'health', 'Moncayo', 'frontline', 'construction', 'criminal', 'pact', 'people', 'individuals', '9/11', 'Hurricane Sandy', 'health care', 'sanitation', 'transit', 'business model', ""workers' compensation"", 'assistant district attorney', 'district attorney', 'Labor', 'insurance', 'Manhattan DA', 'Lower Manhattan', 'business plans', 'COVID-19', 'fair pay', 'civil penalties', 'insurance fraud', '#WorkersCompensation', '#DistrictAttorney', '#Coronavirus', '#LowerManhattan', '#Insurance', '#InsuranceFraud', '#Fraud', '#BusinessModel', '#September11Attacks', '#HurricaneSandy', '#HealthCare', '#Sanitation', '#PublicTransport', '#EqualPayForEqualWork', '#AustralianLaborParty', '#CivilPenalty', '#BusinessPlan', '#NewYorkCountyDistrictAttorney']","Exactly five years ago, Carlos Moncayo was crushed to death when the Lower Manhattan building trench he was working in collapsed upon him. Carlos’ death was not due to his own carelessness or a freak accident.Carlos died, a court determined, because his employer put profits ahead of safety. I prosecuted that case, which is how I know that now, in the age of COVID-19, there will be more Carloses, and we must protect them too.We take for granted a basic employment pact: In exchange for work, we get paid what we are owed, and we go home safely. Moncayo was an extreme example of what happens when employers ignore that pact. But his case was also unusual because his employer was held criminally responsible for breaking the employment pact.Crimes committed by companies against workers have long been ignored by law enforcement, even as workers are vigorously held to account. Cases are routinely brought against individuals who make false workers’ compensation insurance claims worth thousands of dollars while companies that commit millions of dollars in workers’ compensation insurance fraud are offered civil settlements and payment plans.This has created a system that overcriminalizes individuals while giving a pass to companies that incorporate fraud into their business model. The enforcement gap has emboldened unscrupulous companies to prioritize the bottom line over the well-being of their workforces while messaging to workers that only they will be held to the letter of the law.We now find ourselves facing an unprecedented crisis, putting thousands of people in harm’s way. And as we did with 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy, we are newly appreciative of the frontline workers who risk their lives to ensure we survive coronavirus.While we shelter in place, people in health care, sanitation, construction, retail, food services, transit, delivery and many other arenas leave their families to care for us, maintain our vital infrastructure and make sure we have enough supplies.But those frontline workers did not suddenly appear. Like Moncayo, they have been invisibly keeping our city going while hoping their employer will be one of the good ones that lives up to their end of the pact.And while there are a few stories of executives forgoing their salaries so that their workers are paid, reports of the firing of workers for demanding safety gear and fair pay are becoming common. Like Moncayo’s employer, these employers are abusing their power to renegotiate the employment pact in their favor.The time has come for New Yorkers to stand together in the fight to protect workers, not simply because it’s the right thing to do but because it affects us all. When companies subject workers to dangerous conditions and cheat them out of wages, it’s taxpayers who foot the bill.Unscrupulous employers cannot be allowed to use this crisis to profit at the expense of their workers. The least that we owe these remarkable individuals is them knowing that law enforcement will be there to enforce the employment pact with criminal penalties.Standing with our frontline workers means we must use every weapon in our arsenal — including criminal prosecution — to vigorously enforce health and safety and wage rules. It is no longer enough to rely on traditional regulators like the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the state Department of Labor. The worst offenders have factored the costs of civil penalties into their business plans. Criminal prosecution is a necessary tool that must also be used.The worst offenders will only change their behavior when the cost of failing to protect workers outweighs the benefits. If we truly want to show our essential workers how much we appreciate their contributions, we need to do more than just applaud them. We must have the courage to stand and support them, using every resource we have.Florence is a former assistant district attorney and head of the Construction Fraud Task Force in the Manhattan DA’s Office."

Officials say this is the first report of a tiger becoming infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.

USDA said samples from the tiger, named Nadia, were taken and evaluated after several lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo presented symptoms of respiratory illness. The zoo said Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions had developed a dry cough and decrease in appetite. They are all expected to recover.

Health officials say the large cats got sick from being exposed to a zoo employee who had COVID-19, but was asymptomatic. The Bronx Zoo has been closed since mid-March; the first tiger began showing signs of sickness on March 27, according to the USDA. No other animals in the zoo are experiencing coronavirus symptoms, officials said.

""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement.

The USDA's press release said ""there is no evidence that animals play a role in the transmission of COVID-19 to people,"" except for the initial outbreak at a food market in Wuhan, China. In addition, there is ""no evidence that any person has been infected with COVID-19 in the U.S. by animals, including by pet dogs or cats.""

The USDA said ""this is the first case of its kind"" and ""further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.""

Health officials recommend frequent hand washing for at least 20 seconds with soap and warm water or use alcohol-based sanitizer.

The Associated Press cites the American Veterinary Medical Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as recommending that out of an abundance of caution, people ill with the coronavirus should limit contact with animals.

The USDA and CDC do not recommend routine testing of animals for coronavirus, according to a press release. Officials say the pandemic is ""ever-evolving"" and ""public and animal health officials may decide to test certain animals out of an abundance of caution."""

This according to U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams, who made the grave announcement on Sunday, saying this week will be the “hardest and the saddest” for “most Americans’ lives.” He also likened coming days to Pearl Harbor and 9/11.
“This is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9/11 moment, only it's not going to be localized, it's going to be happening all over the country and I want America to understand that,” Vice Admiral Adams said on Fox News.
He added, “I want Americans to understand that as hard as this week is going to be, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Washington governor Jay Inslee called Adams' comparison ""ludicrous.""
Officials say the next two weeks will be vital in preventing the continued spread of coronavirus, which has already claimed the lives of nearly 10,000 Americans. Donald Trump echoed these sentiments on Saturday during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House: “This will be probably the toughest week between this week and next week, and there will be a lot of death, unfortunately, but a lot less death than if this wasn't done but there will be death,"" he said
Adams requested that governors who hadn’t yet announced stay-at-home directives to think about a temporary shutdown. “If you can't give us a month, give us a week ... give us what you can,” he said.
A handful of state governors have yet to issue statewide orders that advise residents to stay at home. They have all ignored recommendations made by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert. “If you look at what's going on in this country, I just don't understand why we're not doing that,” Fauci recently told CNN.
Meanwhile, Trump has refused to issue a nationwide order, allowing states to make their own decisions. “We have a thing called the Constitution, which I cherish,” Trump said on Saturday. “Now in some cases we'll supersede ... it depends on the individual state that you're talking about. ... If I saw something wrong, if I saw a massive outbreak, of which there's not, I would come down very hard.”"

(CBS4) – Search and rescue crews in Colorado’s high country are pleading with backcountry users to rethink their next trip to the mountains in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis. The pandemic has hit mountain communities hard.

While Colorado’s Public Health Order allows people to leave their homes to engage in outdoor activity, that activity should be limited to lower-risk endeavors, such as walking, hiking, running and Nordic skiing.

Vail Mountain Rescue Group President Rob Foster says backcountry skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling and sledding/tubing – anything involving mass and velocity, especially in avalanche terrain far from pavement – are not low-risk activities.

As experienced and as careful as you might be, accidents can and will happen, and the chance of that happening escalates with the frequency and volume of outings in the backcountry.

“Be aware that these are not normal times, and that accidents that happen in the backcountry during a pandemic come with a much higher risk to all involved due to the additional threat of COVID-19. Every time you venture outdoors to pursue high-risk activities, you are rolling the dice for yourself, for us, and your community,” Foster explained.

VMRG posted photos on their Facebook page Saturday showing local trailhead parking lots full.

“While you may be able to maintain social distancing when pursuing your chosen outdoor activity by keeping a wide berth from other users you may encounter out on the trail, social distancing goes out the window when something goes wrong and the situation escalates into a matter of life or death. During a backcountry rescue, maintaining a social distance is not possible. Everyone involved in bringing you to safety — yourself included — potentially may be exposed to COVID-19 since you, and we, may be asymptomatic yet still carry the virus. Post-mission, everyone involved may require a 14-day quarantine, impacting our team’s ability to respond to backcountry emergencies, and the resources we can bring to bear in our community’s collective fight against COVID-19,” they cautioned."

Oil prices dropped during overnight trading on Sunday after OPEC+ announced it was delaying its meeting initially scheduled for Monday, stoking fears on the Street that a production cut might face hurdles.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude fell 9.2% to trade at $25.72 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude dipped 8.7% to $31.15 per barrel.

Oil surged last week — WTI and Brent are both coming off their best week on record — as Saudi Arabia called a meeting between between OPEC and its allies, known as OPEC+, signalling there could be progress on a production cut. The organization's March meeting ended with no deal after Russia rejected the 1.5 million barrels per day cut that Saudi Arabia had proposed in a bid to prop up falling oil prices as the coronavirus outbreak sapped demand. This kicked off a price war between the two powerhouse producers.

The Monday meeting was set after President Donald Trump said to CNBC on Thursday that he expected Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to announce a deal to cut production by up to 15 million barrels, and that he had spoken to both countries' leaders.

But tensions between Saudi Arabia and Russia escalated on Friday, and the meeting will now ""likely"" be held on Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter.

""It's probably going to crater,"" Again Capital's John Kilduff said of oil. ""There was a lot of optimism priced into oil Thursday and Friday. With this new Saudi, Russia spat, it doesn't look like it's going to come together.""

Both Saudi Arabia and Russia have sought U.S. cooperation in balancing the world oil supply. Iraq, OPEC's second largest producer behind Saudi Arabia, is also in favor of global action. On Sunday the nation's oil minister said the 14-member cartel and its allies need support from producers ""outside of OPEC+."" His statement mentioned the United States, Canada and Norway specifically.

American drillers are still pumping near record levels as the world is coming to the edge of its ability to store oil.

""The details of the emerging framework are complex, even if the overall picture seems clear on the surface: All in or no deal,"" said Eurasia Group's Ayham Kamel. ""Politically and economically, Putin and Prince Mohammad need US participation in some shape or form.""

U.S. oil executives met with the president Friday at the White House, and there was speculation he would ask them to cooperate in cuts. No agreement came of the meeting, but Trump did seem to reflect an industry view that market forces should determine prices.

""These are great companies and they'll figure it out,"" he said at a White House briefing following his meeting with the energy CEOs. ""It's a free market, they'll figure it out."" The president also said that tariffs are ""certainly a tool in the tool box.""

""A breakdown of these [OPEC+] talks would most likely lead to a US ban or tariffs on non-North American oil imports to support WTI prices, though that would provide only temporary relief before the pressure to shut-in production rises again,"" Kamel added.

The U.S. oil industry is divided on whether it could or should contribute to production cuts in an effort to stabilize prices.

The American Petroleum Industry opposes cuts, saying such a move would harm the U.S. industry. In Texas, however, Ryan Sitton, one of the three members of the Texas Railroad Commission, has said that the state would consider participating in such a deal.

OPEC has invited the Texas commission to participate in its June meeting, and Sitton said on Thursday that he spoke to Russian energy minister Alexander Novak about production cuts.

Oil producing states, like Texas, have the authority to manage production, though the federal government cannot manage production and a consortium of companies cooperating would be seen as an anti-trust violation. The Texas commission last restricted output in 1970. It has set a meeting set for April 14.

Despite last week's surge, West Texas Intermediate crude is still down nearly 40% in the last month on the heels of demand destruction from the coronavirus outbreak, and the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

But some argue that some sort of deal will most likely be reached since it is in producers' best interest to have higher oil prices.

""It still looks like something will happen on the supply front,"" Vital Knowledge founder Adam Crisafulli said Sunday. ""Saudi Arabia and Russia continue to publicly feud, but nearly every producer on the planet is pleading for action and even countries like Canada and Norway, which usually don't participate in global supply actions, now seem willing to contribute. It's unlikely 10M barrels come offline, but some sort of a curb seems very probable by the end of this week,"" he added.

But even if a deal is reached, many argue that prices will stay lower for longer due to the unprecedented demand destruction caused by the coronavirus. In other words, the supply side is a secondary story to the demand hit.

""The energy sector is facing its most challenging fundamental period since the Great Energy Depression of 1981-1995,"" RBC's co-head of global energy research Kurt Hallead said. ""On the oil front, demand is set to decline by amounts never before seen driven by the COVID-19 global economic shock while supply is surging due to the Saudi-Russia oil price war,"" he added.

The total includes 11 staff members and three residents. Of the staff members, eight have had patient care duties. All 14 cases are described as in good condition.

The count a week ago was two patients and seven staff members.

“We expect more cases of COVID-19 in the Laguna Honda community, among staff and residents, because the virus is now spreading throughout the Bay Area,” the city’s Department of Emergency Management said in an announcement. “This is a very challenging time, and (Laguna Honda) has expanded behavioral health resources for staff and residents.”

In response to a request from the city, the California Department of Public Health Department and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sent skilled personnel to Laguna Honda, including infection control nurses, infectious disease physicians and epidemiologists.

“These experts have insights from around the country and across the world to help us do better in our response,” city officials said.

The hospital is under a protective quarantine order issued by the city on March 25.

As of 9 a.m. on Sunday the total number of COVD-19 cases in San Francisco was 568, with eight deaths recorded.

            SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A small coastal city in Georgia that thrives on tourism closed its beach, fearing carefree crowds of teenagers and college students posed too great a risk for spreading the new coronavirus. Two weeks later, the state's governor has reversed that decision, saying people weathering the outbreak need fresh air and exercise.


    
            The clash has thrust tiny Tybee Island, east of Savannah, into a thorny debate that keeps cropping up during the coronavirus pandemic: How much can officials curtail freedoms during the crisis? And should those calls be made at the federal, state or local level?


    
                                            
                    
            Tybee Island Mayor Shirley Sessions, sworn in barely three months ago, has taken on Gov. Brian Kemp after state officials on Friday reopened the beach in this community of 3,100 people. The beach typically operates with city-funded lifeguards, police patrols and trash cleanup.


    
                                
                    
            
                                

            
            The change resulted from the Republican governor's order that people statewide should “shelter in place” — that is, they should stay home unless working jobs deemed essential, seeking medical care, shopping for groceries, or other exceptions including exercising outdoors. It also invalidated any restrictions already imposed by local governments if they went beyond the governor's limits.


    
                                
                    
            
            That meant a unanimous decision by Tybee Island’s city council to close its beach was suddenly overridden, and Sessions said the governor's office declined to reconsider when asked. Her blunt, public rebuttal to what she called the governor’s “reckless mandate” drew attention far beyond her small coastal home.


    
                                
                    
            
            “As the Pentagon ordered 100,000 body bags to store the corpses of Americans killed by the coronavirus, Governor Brian Kemp dictated that Georgia beaches must reopen,” Sessions said in a statement posted Saturday on the city’s website that was quickly spread on social media and quoted in news stories. Tybee Island mayors are elected in nonpartisan races, and Sessions doesn't identify as Democrat or Republican.


    
            Kemp noted Sunday on Twitter that state law enforcement officers were monitoring beaches at Tybee Island and elsewhere to ensure crowds weren’t gathering, and that beach traffic appeared sparse. Kemp said “beach gear and parties are prohibited.”


    
                                

            
            “Patrols are vigilant so people can get fresh air and exercise while following social distancing rules,” the governor tweeted.


    
            The back-and-forth reflects the broader debate in the U.S. about whether severe limitations on people's movement are necessary, causing unacceptable disruption or even constitutional. Some faith leaders, for instance, have argued that bans on gatherings that applied to services violated religious freedom protections. The American Civil Liberties Union is asking a court to block part of Puerto Rico’s strict curfew, expressing concern about overreach. The Los Angeles County sheriff reversed his decision  to shut down firearms dealers after he was sued by gun-rights groups.


    
            On Sunday, there were no lifeguards were on duty on Tybee's beaches, and local officials left in place plywood signs blocking boardwalks and wooden barricades to keep cars out of beachfront parking lots.


    
            “I would say we’re going to leave them up until somebody takes them down,” Sessions said in a phone interview.


    
            The mayor said she doesn’t understand why the state would assert control during the pandemic.


    
            Kemp’s office did not immediately respond to an email Sunday seeking further comment on the governor’s rationale. Kemp’s spokeswoman, Candice Broce, said in a statement Saturday that governor’s staff was in contact with Sessions and would provide resources as needed to enforce social distancing.


    
            Sessions said she’s thinks few people ventured to the beach over the weekend because they weren’t sure whether it was open or closed. She’s concerned that could change. The city moved to shut down the beach after thousands of young people swarmed to the sand and surf as schools and colleges canceled classes.


    
            Local officials worried that carefree crowds posed too great a risk for spreading the virus. Still, it was a painful decision for a city that’s typically hungry for spring tourists after the economically lean winter.


    
            “We are a very high-risk community. We have an older population and two nursing homes. We don’t have a medical facility,” Sessions said. “The sooner we take these actions, the sooner we’ll be able to get back to some type of normalcy.”


    
            For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.


    
            On Sunday, the Georgia Department of Public Health reported more than 6,600 confirmed infections statewide and 211 deaths. Chatham County, which includes Tybee Island and neighboring Savannah, had more than 80 cases and three deaths.


    
            At least one Tybee Island resident is among those infected, Sessions said, as is an officer on the community’s small police force.


    
            Kemp’s order that reopened the beach also lifted a temporary ban Tybee Island had imposed on people checking into vacation rental homes. Sessions said she spotted license plates from New York, New Jersey and other states reeling from the pandemic as she walked the island over the weekend.


    
            And she fears many more visitors will show up for the upcoming Easter weekend.


    
            “I tell people it’s such a small sacrifice,"" said Sessions, who’s still urging people to stay off the beach. ""The beach is going to be there in two months. But will we be there to enjoy it?”"

Of those who died, 11 had underlying health conditions and 10 people were over the age of 65.

To date, there have been 5,940 confirmed cases of COVID-19 across all areas of LA County, including 132 deaths. Officials say a significant number of people infected are asymptomatic and capable of spreading the virus to others.

“Each death represents a person, not just a number, and I am so sorry for every family member and loved one lost to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Barbara Ferrer, PhD, MPH, MEd, Director of Public Health. “We have some very difficult days ahead and now is the time for all of us to redouble our physical distancing efforts and look after our neighbors, friends, and families who may be at the highest risk for serious illness from COVID-19.”"

Downing Street did not say which hospital he was in, and officials emphasized that it had not been an emergency admission.

Johnson confirmed he had tested positive for coronavirus on Friday last week, and has been self-isolating in Downing Street ever since, chairing meetings via videoconference, and having papers and meals left at his door. Ten days on he is still showing symptoms of the illness, including a high temperature.

While officials said Johnson remains in charge of the government, and in contact with his ministers and officials, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will chair Monday morning’s meeting of the government’s COVID-19 “war cabinet,” officials said. The Sunday Times reported last month that Raab had been nominated as ""designated survivor"" should the prime minister be incapacitated.

U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who confirmed that he had also tested positive for coronavirus on the same day as the prime minister, has since recovered and resumed his public role at the forefront of the government’s pandemic response. Johnson’s fiancé Carrie Symonds has also been ill with COVID-19 symptoms and is self-isolating but has not been tested for the virus.

News of Johnson’s admission to hospital came just over an hour after Queen Elizabeth II gave a rare televised address, which was pre-recorded, to rally spirits in what she said was an “increasingly challenging time.”

Leading British politicians including Hancock, Keir Starmer, the new Labour leader, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and London Mayor Sadiq Khan wished the prime minister well on social media.

Asked about the prime minister’s health earlier Sunday, Hancock told Sky News that Johnson was “OK.”

“He has still got a temperature … I was lucky, I had two pretty rough days and then I bounced back and some people do get it pretty mildly, and then for others, it’s very, very serious and the prime minister is not at that end of the spectrum.”"

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures traded more than 200 points higher, or 1.2%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also climbed more than 1%.

The meeting between OPEC and Russia was scheduled for Monday, but sources familiar with the matter told CNBC it will ""likely"" take place Thursday. The delay comes after President Donald Trump told CNBC last week he expected both countries to cut production by up to 15 million barrels.

Trump's comments helped U.S. crude post its biggest-ever weekly gain. West Texas Intermediate futures rallied 12% last week. WTI also jumped 24% on Thursday for its best day on record, lifting equity prices that day as concern about financial and job losses in the energy sector eased.

Crude has taken a beating this year as Saudi Arabia-led OPEC and Russia failed to reach a deal on production cuts while the global spread of the coronavirus dampens the demand outlook for oil. Year to date, WTI has lost more than half of its value.

More than 1.2 million coronavirus cases have been confirmed, according to Johns Hopkins University. The U.S. is by far the country with the most cases at over 330,000. On Saturday, Trump warned ""there will be a lot of death,"" noting the U.S. faces its ""toughest week"" in its fight against the virus.

In New York, the state with the most confirmed cases, the death toll has risen to 4,159 from 3,565 on Saturday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio also said the city will likely run out of ventilators for coronavirus patients by Wednesday."

For cannabis investors, it’s been a tough two years, with the market down substantially from early 2018, when there was extreme enthusiasm following the legalization in California. As of April 3rd, it has declined 88% over the past 27 months, even as it rests above the closing low set on March 18th. I discussed six months ago how the vaping crisis had created a cannabis industry capital crunch, and the COVID-19 crisis has not only accelerated it, but it has also added some other challenges.
 
I recently shared my perspective on how the COVID-19 crisis could impact cannabis stocks, discussing not only the big picture but also how it could affect eight separate sub-sectors. The good news, in my view, is that the industry will likely have strong prospects as we emerge from the crisis, as the path to legalization is likely to be shorter as states seek tax revenue and jobs. Unfortunately, many cannabis companies, both private and public, may not make it that long, which makes security selection more important than ever. 
 
 
At 420 Investor, I have been rapidly reducing exposure to names I consider more vulnerable and allocating towards those that I think are best positioned to weather the storm and capitalize on opportunities in the future. Before I share some ways readers can think about improving their portfolios, I want to discuss the near-term operational challenges and how some companies are already being effectively wiped out.
 
How COVID-19 is Creating Operational Challenges
 
One bright spot has been that almost all states have deemed cannabis retailers as providers of “essential services”, though there have been some notable exceptions, including Massachusetts, which shut down the sale except to medical patients, and the province of Ontario, which reversed its earlier position and forced retailers to close (and forced all sales to go to its own online store).
 
 
The main challenge has been the shift away from stores to delivery, an option that wasn’t previously available in many states, or to pick-up. While there was an early spike in sales in many markets, the inability to walk into stores will cut demand most likely. The costs of serving customers is likely to increase as well. 
 
Another challenge for operators in some states is that tourism has halted. Colorado has summer and winter spikes due to tourist demand, but some other states or cities are extremely dependent on tourism and will suffer greatly. A prime example is Las Vegas, which has shut down completely. I profiled Planet 13 recently, and this company is particularly vulnerable in the near-term, as its 10% market share is heavily dependent upon the tourist population. There are many other companies that derive a substantial amount or even all of their revenue from the Nevada market.
 
In most states, construction is being permitted at this point, but this is another potential challenge for operators, many of which are in the process of bringing on additional production capacity or opening stores. Additionally, regulators aren’t able to move as quickly, and some zoning and permitting approvals may be slow. Lack of regulatory swiftness is likely to slow license transfers as well, hurting the ability of operators to close pending acquisitions.
 
COVID-19 Has Crippled or Killed Several Cannabis Companies
 
We have seen a substantial pick up in companies seeking protection from creditors. Just last week, Canadian licensed producers CannTrust and James Wagner Cultivation did so, joining a few others that have already taken that step, and there are many others likely headed that direction. A good example is RavenQuest Global, which lost one of its licenses after it was evicted from its facility in Alberta for failure to pay rent. The company’s website is no longer functioning.
 
In the United States, MedMen bit the bullet and took on debt with particularly onerous terms last week as it also brought in outside management with restructuring expertise. CBD marketer Green Growth Brands , which had recently announced the sale of its division, instead put it into receivership last week. Surna, a supplier of HVAC equipment, saw two of its three directors abruptly resign after it issued guidance that it may not survive the crisis.
 
It’s going to get a lot worse, unfortunately, as many companies are out of cash and are losing money. Some will price equity offerings at desperate levels, like Tilray did in March, while others will take on debt on onerous terms, as MedMen did. I described the take-under of Indus Holdings in March, a very cautionary story in my view that should leave investors quite concerned about this new threat.
 
Steps Cannabis Investors Should Consider Taking
 
I always remind my subscribers at 420 Investor in both good times and bad to be very careful about how much they allocate to the cannabis sector. In the past, when I have conducted surveys of the community, I have learned that many claim to have more than 75% of their entire investment portfolio in the sector, sometimes more than 100% by using margin. The first thing anyone should do, especially considering that the market has bounced sharply off the bottom set on March 18th, is to make sure that their allocation to the sector is appropriate for the amount of risk they can assume. While I think the future is bright for a small number of companies, the path between here and there could be quite rocky. Quite simply, investors should be prepared for even the relatively safer names to decline in the near-term, so the first step is to reduce exposure if you can’t afford to lose more money. This is likely something that applies to investors in the broad market as well.
 
I always pay attention to the financials, but it has never been more important. One has to have an understanding of how much cash, if any, a company will need, and how they may be able to get it (if at all). We have seen the relatively stronger companies access capital through sale/leaseback transactions, the issuance of debt and the sale of stock. The latter is the safest, in my view, but it can crush the stock. So, the second step is to understand cash needs in the near-term and gauge the ability to access capital.
 
Next, it’s not good enough to be aware of the cash, as often the cash is earmarked for things like debt repayment, capital expansion projects or even meeting short-term needs like accounts payable. In this environment, other short-term assets may not be realized, especially accounts receivable, as we are aware of slow pay in places like California and Nevada, and this was before the current pandemic crisis. So, the next step is to assess the balance sheet very closely. Be very careful relying upon cash values, as debt may be substantial, even if it isn’t due in the short-term. Companies that have debt due in 2022 are already facing substantial scrutiny. There are many companies with high cash balances but significant levels of debt along with operating losses, and the debt may prove to be too big of a burden.
 
My next point is that investors should be very aware of geographical risk. I shared the examples of Nevada and Massachusetts above, but things could change for the worse in other markets potentially. For example, I also profiled Liberty Health Sciences and Trulieve last month when I discussed profitable companies. So far, the Florida market that accounts for all of Liberty’s and nearly all of Trulieve’s revenue has been quite robust, but it is likely to slow as new potential patients struggle to register with the state. Additionally, while I don’t expect Florida to do so, it’s always possible that any city or state could move to close the operations of a cannabis company. So, investors should be careful not to take on too much geographical risk. More diversified companies may be a better option, though, of course, it’s important that they have relatively strong financials and access to capital.
 
Finally, be prepared for equity raises from even the relatively strongest companies. What this means to me is to not be over-exposed to the stock of any company, saving some gunpowder to buy the inevitable dip when the company does sell stock. While I don’t consider Tilray to be a relatively strong company, the recent action does indicate what can happen when a company does sell stock. In this case, the deal, which included shares of stock along with warrants, was priced at $4.76, and the stock fell to an all-time low of $2.43 just days later. Identifying the future winners doesn’t mean one has to go all-in today.
 
The Bottom Line
 
Tying it all together, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated the capital crunch that emerged for the industry in September, when the vaping crisis hit. It has also created some operational challenges that will likely hurt the growth in the short-term of even relatively healthy companies. The silver lining is that the industry should experience stronger growth than many other industries as the crisis ensues and will likely see enhanced future growth due to legalization being accelerated as a means to gain tax revenue and job growth for states. Unfortunately, the risks to poorly capitalized and unprofitable cannabis operators have increased dramatically, and many of these won’t benefit from that future growth. Investors should choose their cannabis stocks very carefully in this environment, trying to find those companies that will survive now and thrive with diminished competition in the future."

The global pandemic of the highly contagious respiratory disease brought normal life to a halt in Colorado after it hit the state in March.

Colorado residents are under a stay-at-home order that prohibits nonessential travel and business operations. On Friday, Gov. Jared Polis asked everyone in the state to wear a mask when out in public, and asked residents to make their own cloth masks rather than trying to buy medical-grade masks, which should be reserved for healthcare workers.

Newly resurfaced footage of then-President George W. Bush urgently warning of the risks posed by pandemics in 2005 -- ""If we wait for a pandemic to appear, it will be too late to prepare,"" Bush said at the National Institutes of Health -- has drawn belated praise from his detractors, and raised new questions as to the state of the federal government's disaster preparedness since his administration.
In particular, a USA Today fact-check recently confirmed that the Obama administration had allowed the N95 mask stockpile to deplete following a series of crises, and apparently ignored calls for experts to renew the stockpile. President Trump repeatedly has blamed his predecessor for the shortage as well, although he also apparently took no efforts to replenish the materials.
Former top Bush adviser Karl Rove told Fox News on Sunday that, while Bush implemented a pandemic plan, it wasn't properly maintained.
""The thing that gets me is, the national stockpile was built, and this was one of the issues... we had to make certain we had enough material in that stockpile, and there are a couple of issues here,"" Rove said. ""One is this equipment -- there's a different durability to each item in the stockpile. If you've got yourself a ventilator, it's got a long life -- now it may be made obsolete by changes in technology, but it's got a relatively long shelf life.""
NEW YORK REPORTS FIRST DROP IN CORONAVIRUS DEATHS
He added: ""But, masks do have a shelf life. You can't make a mask and have it have the same impact in 10 years that it might have in two years. So, this means budgetary questions, because you're gonna have to replenish parts of the stockpile periodically.
""What amazed me was the fact that -- I think it was 2014, when they used so many N95 masks out of the stockpile and they were not replenished,"" Rove continued. ""I think the same thing happened with some of the stockpile of ventilators. This is the kind of thing that once you're committed to it, you hope that the only reasons you change the commitment to it is because there's a change in technology, not a change in finances.""
At the same time, Rove also asserted that it was something of an overstatement to say, as ABC News reported, that the former president was ""obsessed"" with pandemics. But, Rove said, it was true that Bush had read John M. Barry's ""The Great Influenza"" on the 1918 flu pandemic, and undertook comprehensive action.
""I think the word 'obsessed' is a little bit too much,"" Rove told Fox News, calling the ABC News piece somewhat ""overdrawn"" in its language.
""Bush is the one who says, 'OK we've got to have a goal, let's work towards the goal,'"" Rove said. ""And, Bush prodded to move people along in that way, but 'obsessed' is not a word I'd use for Bush. He's just focused.""
Homeland security adviser Fran Townsend told ABC News that Bush implemented an ""intense"" effort, including war games in which Cabinet officials planned pandemic responses, diagrams for global early warning systems, funding for rapid vaccine technologies and a stockpile for masks and ventilators.
""You've got to read this,"" Townsend said the president told her, referring to Barry's book. ""He said, 'Look, this happens every 100 years. We need a national strategy.'""
During the Bush administration, Rove said, the president took the situation seriously and the warnings were dire.
""I've told people more than once during this last couple of months that as scary as the briefings were about the war on terror, the scariest briefings I had at the White House were about pandemics, because the speed with which these could be transmitted, first from animals to humans and then spread among the global, interconnected environments in which we live -- I didn't think I'd see something like we're going through now, but this is what they were talking about,"" Rove said.
JOURNALISTS CHANGE TUNE AFTER MOCKING TRUMP ON POSSIBLE CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT
""Remember, [Bush] went through SARS in 2002 and 2003,"" Rove went on. ""One of the issues... at that time... the technology was such that the only way, once you created a vaccine, the only way to manufacture the vaccine was to get one egg per dose and incubate the vaccine in that egg -- so we literally were having meetings about how many eggs could be produced and how rapidly in order to incubate any prospective vaccine.""
Those experiences were likely on Bush's mind when he delivered his now-viral address at the NIH on pandemics.
""A pandemic is a lot like a forest fire: if caught early, it might be extinguished with limited damage; if allowed to smolder undetected, it can grow to an inferno that spreads quickly beyond our ability to control it,"" Bush said in his November 2015 speech to the NIH, which Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been leading the current pandemic response, attended. ""A flu pandemic would have global consequences, so no nation can afford to ignore this threat, and every nation has responsibilities to detect and stop its spread.""
""It is vital that our nation discuss and address the threat of pandemic flu now,"" Bush added. ""There is no pandemic flu in our country or in the world at this time -- but if we wait for a pandemic to appear, it will be too late to prepare, and one day, many lives could be needlessly lost because we failed to act today.""
The newfound praise for Bush's comments among several news outlets and personalities, however, has led some observers to point out that glowing coverage was nowhere to be found during his time in office.

It's not a guideline. It's not a suggestion. It's an unbreakable rule: The only good Republican is the previous Republican.""

Officials say this is the first report of a tiger becoming infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.

USDA said samples from the tiger, named Nadia, were taken and evaluated after several lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo presented symptoms of respiratory illness. The zoo said Nadia, her sister Azul, two Amur tigers and three African lions had developed a dry cough and decrease in appetite. They are all expected to recover.

Health officials say the large cats got sick from being exposed to a zoo employee who had COVID-19, but was asymptomatic. The Bronx Zoo has been closed since mid-March; the first tiger began showing signs of sickness on March 27, according to the USDA. No other animals in the zoo are experiencing coronavirus symptoms, officials said.

""We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world's continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,"" the zoo said in a statement.

The USDA's press release said ""there is no evidence that animals play a role in the transmission of COVID-19 to people,"" except for the initial outbreak at a food market in Wuhan, China. In addition, there is ""no evidence that any person has been infected with COVID-19 in the U.S. by animals, including by pet dogs or cats.""

The USDA said ""this is the first case of its kind"" and ""further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.""

The USDA and CDC do not recommend routine testing of animals for coronavirus, according to a press release. Officials say the pandemic is ""ever-evolving"" and ""public and animal health officials may decide to test certain animals out of an abundance of caution."""

The 93-year-old monarch spoke about the need for solidarity and strength as the world battles coronavirus and feels the economic impact of social distancing. It was only the fourth such appearance during a time of national trouble she has made.

“I am speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time,” the Queen opened. ""A time of disruption in the time of our country.""

The queen offered sympathy to those suffering, and thanks to healthcare workers and others providing essential services. She called on the historically British traits of stoicism in conjuring up the storied attitudes of World War II Britons, imploring her subjects to show that face again — despite the Brexited U.K. being a very different place than it once was.

“I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,” Queen Elizabeth II said, “and those who come after us will say that the Britons of this generation were as strong as any. That the attributes of self-discipline, of quiet good-humored resolve and of fellow-feeling still characterize this country.”

Prime Minister Boris Johnson was late to impose social distancing orders on the country, though they are now in full effect. Johnson himself was hospitalized for coronavirus complications Sunday. The Queen's heir, Prince Charles, has also tested positive for coronavirus. With the country's leadership in such a state, the queen's subjects might just appreciate her sentiment: that ""we will meet again."""

Queen Elizabeth II addressed the United Kingdom on Sunday in a rare speech, urging self-discipline and resolve in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The queen, 93, acknowledged the grief and financial pain that Britons are enduring while also thanking health workers for their service and ordinary people for staying home.

""Together we are tackling this disease and I want to reassure you that if we remain united and resolute, then we will overcome it,"" she said.

""I hope in the years to come, everyone will be able to take pride in how they responded to this challenge,"" she said, ""and those who come after us will say the Britons of this generation were as strong as any.""

The line is a clear reference to Britain's World War II generation, which endured the Blitz and battled the Nazis to help free Europe from fascism. The queen said she was reminded of her first broadcast in 1940, when at age 14 she spoke to children who had been evacuated from their homes for their own safety.

""Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones,"" the queen said. ""But now, as then, we know deep down that it is the right thing to do.""

A single cameraman wearing protective gear filmed video of the queen's speech at her weekend home, Windsor Castle, outside London, while all other technical staff remained in another room, according to the BBC.

The queen ended her remarks by saying the country will succeed.

""And that success will belong to every one of us. We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return. We will be with our friends again. We will be with our families again. We will meet again. But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.""

The U.K. is now on a soft lockdown. People are allowed to venture out of their homes only for grocery shopping, medical reasons and exercise. But the government has warned that outdoor exercise could be banned if people continue to crowd parks and fail to socially distance on this sunny weekend when the temperatures in Greater London have risen to 70 degrees.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson remains in self-isolation after testing positive for COVID-19, while Carrie Symonds — his pregnant fiancée — has COVID-19 symptoms but says she's now doing better."

""The significance of Lucky being 60 years old is very big,"" one of the zoo's animal care specialists said during Lucky's livestreamed birthday celebration.

""It's a tribute to the care that they get with our staff. Their wild counterparts do not live as long because again their teeth wear down, their eyesight changes, even their hearing and their skin is sensitive.""

Fans of Lucky were able to watch her and her two elephant friends, Nichole and Karen, snack on her birthday treats on the livestream. Lucky has been at the San Antonio Zoo since 1962. She's known by her keepers as being one of the sweetest and most laid-back elephants at the zoo. The big girl is a fan of treats and playing fetch. Most Asian elephants in the wild live for an average of 48 years and elephants at the zoo tend to live longer because they receive special food, daily foot work and body checks, according to the zoo. It costs the zoo $3,500 a month to feed one Asian elephant, Tim Morrow, the zoo's president said in an email. The zoo, which is hurting financially due to the coronavirus lockdown, used the celebration as an opportunity to do some fundraising. ""Unlike most zoos in the country, San Antonio Zoo depends 100% on ticket sales, guest spending, grants, and donations to operate. With no visitors, the zoo has lost almost the entirety of its income,"" Morrow said, before asking for donations."

Motor Speedway was marred by a dozen cautions and several retaliatory on-track incidents, one of which forced the disqualification of drivers Kyle Larson and Daniel Suarez.
 As they did in a race for drivers from other NASCAR series on Saturday night, race officials ultimately decided to move to single-file restarts to help reduce the number of cautions.
 Still, Byron was able to lead 114 of the 150 laps on his way to his first win in the eNASCAR competition.
  The racing at virtual Bristol appeared vastly more aggressive than the previous two weeks, which featured races at the virtual Homestead-Miami Speedway and Texas Motor Speedway.
 Asked to what he attributed the hot tempers, Byron said, “I think the easy excuse is to say, ‘Oh, it’s a game’ and all that, but at the end of the day, everyone is racing, and seeing how much time some guys have put in, I know that it means something to them.
 “You’ve got to race. It’s race craft, and I feel like race craft is the same no matter what you’re racing; whether it’s on a computer or at the dirt track or at an asphalt race, it’s the same.
 “Obviously some of the guys further back were obviously causing some wrecks and stuff. So you just have to get through that and try to keep yourself clean through the race.”
  Improving his race craft
 Byron’s background story of utilizing iRacing to launch his real professional racing career is well documented. In nearly 1,500 starts in Oval iRacing competition, Byron has 308 wins and 269 poles.
 Typically in iRacing competition, drivers earn ratings that go from 1,000 to 9,000 (Byron's iRating being above 6000), with the higher the rating, the more proficient the driver. So when he typically competes on his own, Byron runs with other drivers at a similar skill level and normally competes in the top split races.
 The Pro Invitational Series set up by NASCAR during the coronavirus pandemic allows any of the Cup Series drivers to enter so long as they have the necessary equipment to do so, which produces a wide-range of skill throughout the field.
 “I usually race with guys that are around that range or better, and so you’ll have less cautions or you’ll have more quality of race craft, and I feel like when we put our race together, it’s a wide variety of experience levels, so I think that’s just tough to kind of manage,” Byron said.
 “I try to use iRacing because it improves my race craft, and I feel like we’ve been doing a good job of promoting it the right way. We just have to make sure that everyone understands that there are races that you can do on there, and I try to do those races and not just run laps of practice by myself.
 “The races that you can practice on kind of help improve my race craft, and that’s why I use it to try to help me on the real car.”

While some news commentators have maligned millennials, highlighting young adults blissfully partying as the outbreak spreads, the narrative about this generation’s response to the crisis is simply incorrect.

A generation forged by tragic events - including 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and the Great Recession - millennials grew up to be helpers in crisis, with big hearts and big capacities to activate and organize. Their participation trophies taught them to embrace cooperation over competition. They know how to work together to get things done for the greater good. In the end, it won’t simply be millennials’ physical distancing efforts that will help alleviate this public health and financial crisis, it will be their values and leadership.

This crisis makes it clear, now more than ever, that strong millennial leaders will guide us through these times. Take Rep. Lauren Underwood Lauren UnderwoodJim Oberweis wins GOP primary to challenge Illinois Rep. Lauren Underwood Castro forms PAC, boosts five House candidates Overnight Health Care: Pence says 21 people on cruise ship tested positive for coronavirus | NY begs for more testing kits | Trump signs .3B emergency funding package | Experts say mortality rate likely to drop MORE (D-Ill.) who co-led an intergenerational effort to ensure costs will not be a barrier to COVID-19 testing, with Reps. Katie Porter (D-Calif.) and Rosa DeLauro Rosa Luisa DeLauroWork Share: How to help workers, businesses and states all at once Trump administration issues guidance scaling back paid leave requirement for small business employees Stimulus price tag of .2T falls way short, some experts say MORE (D-Conn.).

At school boards, millennial leaders like Jennifer Bacon in Denver are ensuring students still have meals provided. State legislators, like Del. Jheanelle Wilkins in Maryland, are partnering on housing policies to protect renters and homeowners.

But they don't have to be elected officials to be the leaders our nation needs right now. There is an ecosystem of millennial leaders contributing to the well-being of our communities. They are the non-profit leaders serving their community’s growing needs with less funding. They are the small business owners and employees, struggling to stay afloat. They are the digital organizers providing social solidarity as we all adapt to physical distancing.

They are also the workers in industries hit hardest by this crisis. Millennials are 48 percent of workers in clothing stores, 49 percent of workers in restaurants and other food services, and 59 percent of workers in bars.

Millennials’ are putting in overtime to ensure we are all prepared. They are the thousands of doctors, nurses and health care professionals who are on the frontlines of this crisis. They are also 46 percent of the workers in pharmacies and drug stores.

As the nation and the world dive deeper into economic distress, millennials are dealing with the economic impacts of COVID-19 closing businesses and laying off workers, since more than one in three Americans in the labor force are millennials. As of 2016, 57 percent of millennial women were moms. Moreover, millennials make up one in four of the nation’s unpaid family caretakers. The real picture of a millennial during this crisis is someone not only dealing with economic strain, but working to balance homeschooling their kids, caring for their parents, all the while leading the transition to digital work.

Despite their portrayal as footloose and fancy-free, millennials are taking action to keep communities healthy and connected and will be there to rebuild what will be lost during this pandemic. These leaders will continue to focus on caring for and partnering with the generations who paved the way, as well as the generations that come after them.

Our grandparents came together during World War II to protect democracy. Our parents led the civil rights, women's rights, LGTBQ rights, immigrant rights and peace movements for a better country. This crisis is millennials' opportunity to pick up the baton. We are ready.

Clare Bresnahan English is president and CEO of New Leaders Council (NLC), the nation’s largest training organization of progressive millennial leaders. With 50 state and city chapters and nearly 9,000 fellows and alumni representing the robust diversity of our nation, NLC provides a rising generation of leaders with the resources and community needed to protect our shared future."

  Few people are as knee-deep in our work-related anxieties and sticky office politics as Alison Green, who has been fielding workplace questions for a decade now on her website Ask a Manager. In Direct Report, she spotlights themes from her inbox that help explain the modern workplace and how we could be navigating it better.



  
  Job hunting can be difficult at the best of times. It’s absolutely dismal right now. With layoffs climbing into the millions, workers are being abandoned into an economy where, in many fields, it feels impossible to find a job anytime soon.



  



  



  
  There’s never been a more depressing time to be a work advice columnist. I started Ask a Manager in 2007, right before the 2008 recession hit, so for years my inbox was full of questions from frustrated, desperate job seekers. This is far worse than that.



  



  



  
  I’m hearing from people whose job searches had been going well and were often on the verge of job offers when everything suddenly came screeching to a halt:



  
  I’ve been interviewing with a company for two months, they checked my references, and had told me to expect an offer. This was a field I’ve wanted to get into for a long time, and I was thrilled. Then everything blew up. The distraught hiring manager called to tell me they have a hiring freeze, everything is on hold, and there’s no telling when or if they’ll move forward with the job. Meanwhile, two other companies canceled interviews with me this week. I’m starting to panic.




  



  
  Even worse off are the people who accepted job offers—and quit their current jobs—only to then find out the new job has been put on hold due to layoffs, a hiring freeze, or overall uncertainty. In some cases, these people have been able to ask for their old jobs back, but some of them are now unemployed, without the old job or the new one:



  



  



  



  
  I left my full-time job at the beginning of March for a great offer at a company I was excited to join. I planned to take a few weeks off before starting my new job. Then Covid-19 struck. My new employer has been hard hit, and my job with them has been put on hold indefinitely. My old employer has already hired someone into my old position, so I can’t go back. I don’t have either job and am stuck in limbo.




  



  
  And then there are the heartbreaking accounts from people who graduated into the 2008 recession, were finally catching up professionally, and are now hit with this:



  
  I work in a museum, and am pretty certain my job is unlikely to survive this. I just graduated from graduate school with a load of debt (my plan was to join the program that forgives your loans after 10 years if you work in nonprofits, so if nonprofits are laying people off and not hiring I am pretty well forked, can’t afford to pay those off on my own) and I just moved into a new apartment in my dream city, with my dream job. Now it’s crumbling in front of me, I’m terrified that I’m going to have to give up all those dreams and move back in with my mom in my home state. I spent 10 years making this dream a reality, and after two months it’s been gutted. When I graduated college I had to live at home because of lack of jobs and it put me into a depressive episode I’m still untangling myself from. I’m afraid if I have to move home I’ll be stuck there forever, and will be unlikely to be able to try this again.
And at the same time, I know I’m being an entitled whiner because there are people out there who are afraid they’re literally going to die, and I’m over here crying because of cancelled dreams. The fact that I even have a place to move back to makes me so lucky, and I know I should be more appreciative of that.




  



  



  



  
  I don’t have good answers for these people. Not yet, anyway. Right now things are so up in the air that it’s impossible to give good advice. I’m hoping that will change in a few months—that some of this uncertainty will clear, companies will be more willing to move forward with hiring, and people can again job-search with some success. The best direction I can offer now is to hunker down if you’re somewhere stable and proceed with real caution before making a move. If you can’t avoid a job search right now because you’re unemployed, don’t be surprised if hiring processes are slow or full of false starts. And if you’re in a position to help others—with references, job leads, or contacts—be as generous as you can. People will need all the help and support they can get.



  
  It’s also worth noting that it’s not all dismal. People are getting hired (think health care, tech, biotech, finance, and all the industries you see on states’ “essential business” lists), some industries are still relatively stable, and companies are figuring out how to on board new hires remotely. But it’s hard out there right now, and there’s likely to be more pain before we’re through this.

(AP) — Missouri reported 10 more deaths from COVID-19 Sunday, even while a national database was reporting a higher number in the state.

The state said 34 people have died from the virus, an increase from 24 reported Saturday. A database operated by Johns Hopkins University has recorded 44 COVID-19 deaths in Missouri as of Sunday.

Missouri also reported 2,367 confirmed coronavius cases on Sunday, up 76 from the 2,291 reported Saturday.

The increases come as Missouri residents prepare to live under a statewide stay-at-home order, which requires them to stay home except for essential needs, such as buying groceries. The order also requires public schools to stay closed, bans visits to nursing homes, and limits the number of customers allowed in grocery stores and other essential businesses.

Gov. Mike Parson announced the order on Friday, and it was to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday. It is currently scheduled to expire on April 24.

The discrepancy in deaths between the state and Johns Hopkins could be because Missouri had not required that coronvirus deaths be reported within 24 hours until it changed that policy as of Sunday.

The Johns Hopkins data is updated in near-real time all day, using publicly available data from several sources that do not always agree, spokeswoman Jill Rosen said in an email. The more frequent updates often result in higher case numbers than those available from sources that don't update as frequently, such as state databases.

St. Louis County had the most deaths reported by the state, with 12. All but one death occurred in people between the age of 50 and 80 or over, state health officials said.

Most infected people develop mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within three weeks, such as fever and cough. But older adults and people with existing health problems are particularly susceptible to more severe illness, including pneumonia.

On Saturday, Parson said Missouri is looking for medical professionals who are not working to join a specialized Missouri Disaster Medical Assistance team, which would respond to critical medical emergencies.

At the same time, the Missouri National Guaurd and state and federal partners are evaluating about a dozen sites across the state that could be used for temporary medical facilities and patient care needs if necessary. The groups have visited facilities in St. Louis, Kansas City, Cape Girardeau, Columbia, Springfield and Joplin.

The Guard said it has also done “virtual” assessments of more than 100 other sites in the state that could be used if needed."

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Three more residents diagnosed with COVID-19 have died at a Virginia long-term care facility, the center disclosed on Sunday, bringing the death toll from one of the nation's worst coronavirus clusters to 20.

The administrator of Canterbury Rehabilitation & Healthcare Center in suburban Richmond have announced three additional deaths since Friday.

More than 90 Canterbury residents have tested positive and are receiving treatment at the hospital or at the center, according to administrator Jeremiah Davis. Another 35 residents have tested negative, while 25 health care workers at the center also have tested positive.

Data from the Virginia Department of Health showed more than 2,600 positive COVID-19 cases statewide and at least 51 deaths as of Sunday morning. There are well over 400 hospitalizations.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, and the vast majority survive. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause pneumonia or death.

Government offices in Montgomery County are now closed for two weeks to both workers and citizens because two employees have tested positive for COVID-19.

The decision to shut down the entire Montgomery County government center in Christiansburg came shortly after Friday’s announcement that the entire 68-person Department of Social Services was under quarantine for a week because a worker had tested positive, The Roanoke Times reported. News of a second government worker testing positive came late Friday, county spokeswoman Jennifer Harris said Saturday.

Montgomery County Public Safety and other government functions located outside of the government center will continue to operate, Harris said. Water and sewer services, trash pickup and some animal will continue. But others inside the center — the local voter registrar, treasurer and commissioner of the revenue among them — will be shut down.

Lady Gaga Flexes Her 'Chromatica' Claws in New Album Cover Art: See the Pics



4/5/2020

Lady Gaga has revealed the cover art for her upcoming sixth album, Chromatica, and it could pass as the still from a fierce, fabulous sci-fi action flick.

In a series of photos she shared on Sunday (April 5), Gaga rolls with the aesthetic she introduced in the music video for ""Stupid Love,"" Chromatica's first single. The cotton candy-pink hair is back, but Chromatica's cover is a bit darker and sharper than the vibrant desert dance party of ""Stupid Love"" and the bold magenta graphic with the album's logo she previously introduced. Think Mad Max: Fury Road meets Alien, but with a Haus of Gaga twist: wearing galactic armor (and a pair of platform boots with a tusk and a knife for its heels), the pop star is lying across the grate of a metal structure and beneath the steely wave of Chromatica's insignia. One hand is covered in talons, the other a shoulder-to-fingertip sleeve covered in spikes.


The vinyl record and cassette cover feature Gaga in a different pose, this time with even longer claws and shimmering fuchsia shoulder pads.


The graphics arrive days after she announced that Chromatica's release -- which was originally scheduled for May -- would be postponed in light of the global coronavirus pandemic. She assured her fans then that she'd have ""surprises"" to keep them excited about Chromatica in the coming weeks, and these visuals definitely give Little Monsters something to savor as they await news of her new album release date."

Before the Coronavirus interupted the Jaguars’ offseason schedule in Mid-March, the players and coaches were enjoying their free time away from football. Now, weeks later, the National Football league is preparing for the 2020 season with the coronavirus in mind. Jaguars head coach Doug Marrone, along with his staff, is also focusing on the upcoming year in a different way. Marrone met with members of the media this week to disucss a number of topics ranging from free agency to the upcoming NFL Draft. Here are four takeaways from that conversation. 
 
Jaguars 2020 Vision 
 
Marrone said he wants his unit to be a “big, strong, tough and smart football team”. He added that he wants players who enjoy playing and share the love of the game without any drama. 
 
“We want people to be on the same page, as far as everything we’re doing is all about just trying to win. All the individual things will come if we win football games,” Marrone said. “That’s the one thing that I’ve always tried to preach from the beginning, from when I first started coaching, whether it be as a position coach or as a coordinator or as the head coach, those are the things that I’m looking for.” 
 
 
Specifically, on the field, Marrone said he wants to bring in players that can stop the run. 
 
“Usually bigger people can tackle better, they’re a little big bigger, and as long as they’re athletic enough, and they can run their feet and run their hands and get people down on the ground, so that’s a priority for us and what we’re trying to accomplish there,” Marrone noted. “I think offensively we’re expecting our offensive line to take a big jump from what they did last year, but again, how many weapons, how many playmakers do we have surrounding the quarterback position? Do we have enough of those guys that can make plays? That’s really the key when you look at it, explosive plays are coming from playmakers.”

Draft Preparation
 
Front offices around the NFL are preparing for the upcoming draft differently this season as a result of social distancing. FaceTime phone calls and Zoom sessions are some ways the teams can evaluate a prospect on a more personal level.
 
“I think that helps quite a bit,” Marrone explained. “You can look at someone or tell them to put a board behind them. And you can work some things with them.”
 
Marrone added that this process reminds of him of the days he was a college coach. The Jaguars head coach kicked off his college coaching career in 1992 at Cortland (N.Y.) State as the school’s tight ends coach before serving as the offensive line coach at U.S. Coast Guard Academy (1993) and Northeastern University in 1994. Marrone served as the head coach for Syracuse, his alma mater, from 2009-12. 
 
Marrone appreciates that many college players are posting workouts of themselves on social media. He also revealed that NFL teams are logging calls to players and there is more sharing of information around the league when it comes to injuries. 
 
“It reminds me a lot of college when everyone had a call log and everyone had to write down the time, write down the time that ended,” Marrone said. “Our coaches are doing a really good job of that. I think it’s something that we are going to get quite a bit from.”
 
Jaguars On Social Distancing
 
The uncertainty surrounding upcoming workouts and the season is something Marrone keeps an eye on. Meanwhile, he understands the challenges for players that go along with the act of social distancing. 
 
“I think with the players, it is very difficult. We are in a dead period. We have gotten a bunch of stuff out more from the standpoint of precautionary, making sure you are listening,” Marrone explained. “Making sure everyone is on board with how serious this is and how we have to all pull together and do our part to defeat this virus and stop it from spreading.” 
 
While the team has provided tips for the players and stayed in communication with them, the coaches are also adjusting to the change.
 
“As far as us as coaches, we are trying to stay with the schedule knowing that things are obviously not open for us right now and it is something that is changing throughout time,” Marrone said. “We’re getting everything prepared from a standpoint of our installations. We are getting ready to tape a lot of meetings and things of that nature, so if we are allowed to send things out to the players, they can be able to look at it at their own pace and work on their profession in a safe environment.”

The Future Of Defensive End Yannick Ngakoue
 
The Jaguars placed the franchise tag on defensive end Yannick Ngakoue in mid-March. Last year, Ngakoue played the final year of his four-year rookie contract worth $3,480,000 with Jacksonville according to Spotrac.com. The one-year franchise tag is worth $17,788,000, also per Spotrac.com. The move allows the Jaguars to continue negotiating with him. Also, he can negotiate and sign with another team. However, the Jaguars would have the right to match the offer or they would receive two first-round draft picks from the team that signed Ngakoue. The 25-year-old has made it known on social media that he does not want to play for Jacksonville. 
 
 
  

 
Marrone, who played two years in the league, appreciates what Ngakoue has done for his team. 
 
“I’m just hoping that somewhere down the line or somehow all this stuff can be resolved in a way, but again I understand both sides to it. It’s a part that I’ve always struggled with, the business end of it,” Marrone admitted. “It’s just tough. It really is, especially with a player that has done everything we’ve asked. I’m hoping that somewhere down the line we can get this situation resolved.”
 
Meanwhile, Marrone will continue to work diligently to tweak his roster for the 2020 season."

The 263-page document planning for the pandemic predicts that the worst-scenario of a coronavirus outbreak in the state prison system, which holds almost 22,000 inmates, would lead to an estimated 185 deaths.

The Alabama Department of Corrections (ADOC) said in this scenario it would request assistance from the National Guard to fill in staffing gaps.

The document dated April 1 said the prisons’ physical design, severe overcrowding and understaffing could make stopping the spread of the virus among prisoners and employees impossible, according to AL.com.

The department is also expecting to pay $2.3 million for supplies to respond like personal protective equipment, medication and body bags, according to the document that was signed by Ruth Naglich, the associate commissioner for health services.

The plan says all inmates suspected of having COVID-19 or those who have just arrived should be quarantined but recognizes some prisons will not have the space for that.

ADOC Commissioner Jefferson Dunn told AL.com that the department is doing everything it can to prevent a widespread outbreak.

""The number one thing in my mind is safety, is trying our best to prevent the virus from getting into the facilities, and then mitigating the impact,"" he said.

The department has reported no prisoners to be diagnosed with COVID-19, although two employees have tested positive. Twenty-one prisoners have been tested, with nine cases still pending, according to its website.

Two Alabama prisons are sewing facemasks for other inmates and prison staff across the state. They are expected to produce 2,000 to 2,500 masks a day, AL.com reported.

Some experts have proposed Alabama follow in other states’ footsteps and release certain subsets of prisoners to reduce overcrowding, like those who are elderly, have severe medical conditions or have little time left on their sentences.

California, Michigan, New Jersey and New York have designated populations to release from prisons."

However, many couples in the Valley may not be able to say “I do.”

With the COVID-19 pandemic causing self-quarantines and social distancing, social gatherings are being cleared off the calendar — and that includes weddings.

Pyle said that many of her upcoming bookings have been canceled or postponed until fall — some even postponed as late as next summer.

“This is a huge hit for people in the wedding industry right now because we’re not booking for spring or summer anymore and all of our fall dates are going to be filled up with what he had booked for spring and summer,” she said. “We’re pretty much tapped out for the rest of the year.”

Pyle has spent the Gov. Newsom-mandated lockdown at home in Hanford with her three young children, while her husband — an essential worker — is at the proverbial office.

Pyle took the opportunity to photograph a Pioneer Elementary School parade Thursday afternoon. Her 6-year-old son, Benjamin, attends kindergarten classes at the school and wanted to show his support for teachers and his fellow students at the parade.

“The teachers even seemed super emotional seeing all their students. Parents watching on the street were all really happy and some even mentioned that they cried watching the teachers drive by, seeing their reactions and seeing the kids react to seeing their teachers,” Pyle said, getting emotional. “It’s sad. It was beautiful but it was really sad.”"

Tony Spell — the pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church in Central, outside of Baton Rouge, which is one of the cities hardest hit by the virus — was charged last week with refusing to abide by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards’ order that temporarily limits gatherings to 10 people.


Roughly 1,800 people attended last week’s services, Spell said during a Sunday appearance on CNN’s “New Day Weekend.” Following his interview, hundreds of worshippers gathered at the church once again, Reuters reported.


“We believe the science of this,” Spell told Blackwell. “However, we do have a command from God and there are no governing bodies that can tell us we cannot gather and worship freely.”


Blackwell asked Spell whether he believes the science that shows people who gather in large groups are at greater risk of contracting the virus. 


“Yes, we believe the science,” Spell said, noting that many people who contract the virus “don’t even know they have it” and often recover from it. “People have been locked up in their homes for 22 days now. ... And the hope is the last stronghold in those people’s lives.”


Blackwell continued to press him.


“If you believe the science ― and I assume you are pro-life, is that correct?” Blackwell asked Spell, using the term adopted by many people who oppose reproductive rights. Spell confirmed that he is.


“How is this a pro-life stance to put people in jeopardy of contracting a disease, getting a virus that has no treatment, no cure, often has no symptoms and has killed more than [8,500 people in the U.S.] in five weeks?” Blackwell continued.


Spell responded that “people’s hope is in the House of God.”


“If they do contract the virus, if they have fears of the virus, the church is more essential now than ever,” Spell said. “There is a physician in Jesus Christ.”


“We were supposed to be at a million-and-a-half body bags,” he added. “We’re at 8,400. So the narrative is false.”


As of Sunday afternoon, there were more than 331,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, across the country. More than 9,400 people have died. Louisiana has become one of the hot spots in recent weeks, with more than 13,000 confirmed cases and at least 477 deaths.


Late last month, President Donald Trump proposed easing social distancing measures and encouraging economic activity by Easter, which is April 12. But public health experts on the White House’s coronavirus task force convinced him to extend the restrictions, warning that millions of people could die if he didn’t.



Spell was charged last week with six misdemeanor counts of violating Edwards’ stay-at-home order. Each count carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $500 fine, reported The Associated Press.




“Instead of showing the strength and resilience of our community during this difficult time, Mr. Spell has chosen to embarrass us for his own self-promotion,” Central Police Chief Roger Corcoran said in a statement last week.

“This is not an issue over religious liberty, and it’s not about politics,” the statement continued. “We are facing a public health crisis and expect our community’s leaders to set a positive example and follow the law.”

Spell denied that he was seeking to promote himself.






“If this were about self-promotion then I would livestream and televise my services, which we have the ability to do but we refuse to because the word of God commands us to assemble together,” he said. “This is an attack on religious liberty in the greatest nation in the world.”


Asked what distinguishes his church from the tens of thousands of places of worship in the U.S. that are holding services online during the pandemic, Spell said “conviction.”


“Neither the pressure of our friends, family, lawsuit, jail or death will stop us from operating our convictions, which is let us go into the house of the Lord,” he said.


The Central Police Department did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment.

As per a report by Reuters, US officials from various agencies met on Wednesday to discuss alterations to the Foreign Direct Product Rule. For the most part, thatÂs the legal framework that allows the US to regulate certain foreign-made goods that are based on US technology or software.


Up until now, this set of rules has been successfully leveraged to keep certain Huawei and subsidiary hardware and equipment, including smartphones, off of US markets in varying degrees. The US has been coupling these efforts with an ongoing campaign with its allies to limit HuaweiÂs global involvement in 5G infrastructure projects. The main justification being spying concerns.


Throughout all this, Huawei has managed to flex some impressive muscle and work around many of the restrictions, especially solidifying its domestic market positions to insure its future. Clearly, a move not particularly enjoyed by certain US officials. 


As per the source, these new alterations to the  Foreign Direct Product Rule will require foreign companies that use US chip making equipment to obtain a specific license, before they can supply chips to Huawei.






Some analysts believe this move is specifically aimed at the relations between Huawei and its own HiSilicon in-house division and the TSMC foundry Â manufacturer of a large portion of modern ARM SoC units. Apparently, TSMC, as well as most chip manufacturers utilize equipment in their fabs from US companies, such as KLA Corp, Lam Research and Applied Materials.


If the new rules do come into effect, Huawei might actually be forced to re-work a large part of its supply chain, to even get its Kirin chipsets manufactured for domestic use. As per our understanding, on a more positive note, itÂs just the sophisticated SoC components that will likely be affected, with cheaper, mode common chips not affected by the new regulations.






Naturally, US and China relations, as a whole, have been further complicated recently by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, president TrumpÂs most recent statements on the subject of the Huawei scandal have been signaling a readiness to re-negotiate terms and restore business relations. Presumably, in no small part due to fears that stricter regulations might just end up hurting the US economy quite badly. ItÂs still early to say, then, whether these new changes to the Foreign Direct Product Rule will even be signed-off on and see the light of day.

  Getty 
  
 
There has been an image floating around LinkedIn and Twitter asking people what inspired their digital transformation. Was it 1. CEO 2. CTO or 3. Covid-19? Already, 70% of companies had a digital transformation in place or were working on one. 
 
 
  
  
   
   Digital Transformation Quiz
 
   
  Susanne Wolk (Twitter) 
  
 
There a few reasons why the Coronavirus, or COVID-19 have forced companies to visit a digital transformation faster. One Forbes contributor Andrew Filev in his column “COVID-19 Is A Before and After Moment In The Digital Transformation” sees the most drastic change in four areas 1. telecommuting 2. on-demand food and services 3. virtual events 4. the cloud. 
 
 
Telecommuting
 
Many people in industries that formerly prohibited are now working from home, from bankers, to engineers in aerospace, to almost every teacher in America, work-life has changed for most of us. In order to not only continue working, we are spending our social time on video calls as well, in order to not completely isolate. 
 
On-Demand Food and Services
 
Grocery delivery is now the norm for many people who wouldn’t bother in the past. My own brother who lives in NYC ordered groceries from Amazon and said he could only get a delivery from 5am to 7am, but was frustrated when they arrived at 4:50am. At my own Whole Foods Market in Oakland on a recent Friday said they were “sold out” of delivery. Insurance companies who made it difficult for patients to be reimbursed for telehealth or remote services, will now need to change their tune and reimburse for things like remote therapy. Today if you can’t alter the way your products and services are delivered, you are dead in the water, as most of America and the world are under strict shelter-in-place orders.
 
 
Virtual Events
 
With no one flying, and gatherings prohibited, the events industry took a big hit this Spring. But many companies have simply shifted their budgets to digital events or digital content. Only time will tell if the fall will be a very busy events season, or companies will decide they look doing more online events over in-person events, and we’ll see more innovation on the virtual events side. From an internal corporate perspective, every day I see people posting photos of their large online meetings with their coworkers, and fun stories from teams that are learning to enjoy this new way of working. 
 
The Cloud
 
Without the cloud during the Coronavirus pandemic, companies would struggle to share and co-edit documents securely, access analytics and much more. Even short physical distances would present a challenge for collaboration between coworkers without the cloud. Real-time wouldn’t be as easy, streaming would be a problem, smart phones wouldn’t be smart, and rapid data to name a few.
 
For many of you that are not used to a digital way of work, COVID-19 might have expedited your timeline for a digital transformation - and that’s not a bad thing.
 
Digital transformation seems to be the current business buzzword. But not all digital transformations are created equally. 
 
According to research in Harvard Business Review, of the $1.3 trillion spent on digital transformation in 2018, an estimated $900 billion was wasted when initiatives didn’t meet their goals. You don’t want this to be your company. 
 
Although most companies understand the importance of digital transformation, many are overwhelmed by the idea of having to revamp their entire digital approach and flounder without knowing how to implement a transformation. But they also realize that if they don’t do anything, they run the risk of being disrupted and replaced.
 
The goal of a digital transformation is to use technology to solve traditional problems, which means integrating technology into every area of the business. When done right, digital transformation allows companies to provide unprecedented value to customers.
 
Companies start a digital transformation, but it’s never truly over. A true digital transformation is a state of mind for a company to continually evolve and adopt new digital solutions internally and externally. One of the first goals of digital transformation is to break down internal silos to create a seamless internal experience. When a company works well internally, it greatly affects the external customer experience. Every area of the company has a role to play in digital transformation, and they each impact the customer in unique ways. Lasting digital transformations are customer-focused with an eye towards the future.
 
Digital transformation doesn’t have to be overwhelming. It’s not something to check off a list, but instead a mindset that becomes part of the organization’s culture and experience. When a company approaches a transformation with that in mind, it creates a much more manageable transformation. Many of you are now working against the clock, and my 12 steps might get you there faster. At its simplistic level digital transformation is solving traditional problems with technology.
 
 
  
  
   
   Blake Morgan's Digital Transformation Framework
 
   
  Blake Morgan 
  
 
Here are my 12 steps to digital transformation, adapted from my book The Customer Of The Future:
 
 
 
 Customer focus. Before a digital transformation can truly begin, the company must switch its mindset from being product-focused to being customer-focused. The driving force behind technology decisions should be customers, and the goal should be to make their lives easier instead of making things easier for the organization. A customer focus is the basis for all other digital transformation decisions.
 
 Organizational structure. Companies need to break down internal silos to create a cohesive organization that embraces change. That means getting executives and leaders on board with the new digital vision.
 
 Change management. Change is hard, no matter how much it will benefit the company. One of the most common reasons digital transformations fail is because employees don’t support them. The most effective change management efforts are aligned with the modern, dynamic business environment.  
 
 Transformational leadership. A successful digital transformation starts from the top with leaders who drive employees towards the vision. Every executive and leader must play a role in championing digital change and uniting the digital transformation with the company’s larger, long-term goals.
 
 Technology decisions. Digital transformation impacts the entire organization, not just one department. An average of 15 people are involved in most technology purchase decisions, which means that everyone’s voices need to be heard.
 
 Integration. All data systems need to work together and be integrated into the company’s internal processes. A streamlined data strategy is required for a successful digital transformation.
 
 Internal customer experience. When focusing on digital solutions for customers, companies also need to consider their internal customers—employees. Getting employee feedback and providing consumer-grade technology solutions empowers employees to provide an amazing experience.
 
 Logistics and supply chain. Digital transformation can be powerful in improving the speed and reliability of the supply chain, from how fast products are manufactured to the speed and efficiency of order fulfilment and delivery. To fully leverage a transformation, companies need to look at how the supply chain can be digitized and improved.
 
 Data security, privacy and ethics. Adopting new digital solutions opens the doors to new questions about data security. Most consumers think their personal data is at risk, which means that adopting company-wide standards for privacy and security should be top of mind. With the many examples of “Zoom Bombing” last week, with hackers sneaking into people’s private meetings — again we are reminded that any data breach or hack can erode your brand. School districts are now looking to alternatives to Zoom. 
 
 Evolution of products, services and processes. Digital transformation requires a change in thinking about how an organization delivers its products and services, and even the products and services themselves. Successful companies push past what’s always been done to find the most efficient and innovative solutions.
 
 Digitization. Digital transformation touches all areas of the organization and blurs the line between digital and physical stores. That means moving past segmented operations to digitize every aspect of the business.
 
 Personalization. Digital transformation provides unparalleled opportunities to offer personalized service to customers. Leverage digital solutions to understand customers and provide recommendations and experiences that are unique to them.
 

 
 
Digital transformation is an ongoing process, which means continually working through these 12 steps. Change and venturing into the unknown can be difficult, but the benefits that come from creating a forward-thinking, customer-focused, digital company can be lasting. Perhaps this is the silver lining for businesses in the age of COVID-19, forced change can be positive - for your employees, partners and customers.

The 4-year-old female Malaysian tiger, Nadia, had developed a dry cough and was tested ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo said in a statement.

The diagnosis was confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratories. It is the first confirmed COVID-19 case in a tiger, according to the USDA.

Several tigers and lions at the zoo showed symptoms of a respiratory ilness, the USDA said.

The tiger who tested positive is believed to have become infected by a zoo employee. The tiger first began to show symptoms on March 27, the USDA said.

""Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,"" the Wildlife Conservation Society's statement said.

""It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.""

OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The number of coronavirus cases in the state surpassed 1,200 Sunday and four more people died of COVID-19, the Oklahoma State Department of Health reported.

There are at least 1,252 cases and 46 COVID-19 deaths, the department said, up from 1,159 cases and 42 deaths reported Friday.

Of the 46 deaths, 35 were people aged 65 or over and the four latest deaths, three men and a woman, were each in that age group. Nine deaths were people aged 50-64 and two were in the 36-49 age group.

At least one case is reported in 57 of the state's counties 77 counties and President Donald Trump on Sunday declared a major disaster in the state, making federal funding available for recovery efforts.

The funding is available to state, tribal, and eligible local governments and private nonprofit organizations for emergency protective measures for areas in the state affected by COVID-19, according to a news release from the White House.

For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death."

A Los Angeles Times article published Thursday included this startling quote from Santa Rosa native Kim Prather, an atmospheric chemist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla:

“I wouldn’t go in the water if you paid me $1 million right now.”

Her reason? According to the L.A. Times article, “Prather fears that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, could enter coastal waters [via runoff and wastewater discharges] and transfer back into the air along the coast.”

In this hypothetical scenario, coronavirus excreted then processed in sewage treatment facilities survives and makes it to the sea where the crashing surf churns it into an aerosol that wafts along the shore where beachgoers inhale it and become infected.

So far, so scary. And Prather’s (literal) money quote was all some news sites needed to crank up the clickbait. One Bay Area site Sunday had a front page photo of the beach at Crissy Field with Golden Gate Bridge in the background over the headline: “California scientist warns people to stay away from beaches during COVID-19 pandemic.”

A Google search for “coronavirus prather beach” will quickly demonstrate how quickly a new angle on the coronavirus pandemic can propagate among media outlets in this sheltered-in-place time. 

But how real is the threat of catching COVID-19 by inhaling the fresh sea breeze? On Saturday, Dr. Prather took to social media to clarify her remarks to the Times.

“Now, what about … where I said I would not go into the ocean if you paid me? That was totally taken out of context and when I first read it, I cringed,” Prather wrote in a lengthy post on her Facebook page. “I made it very clear to (the Times reporter) that SARS-CoV-2 has not been detected in the ocean or atmosphere by anyone. Much research needs to be done to understand this virus and how/if it travels through the environment. It is also a virus that has a fragile “envelope” that if disrupted by heat or water kills the virus — that is very good news.”

The main point Prather wanted to make wasn’t the danger of coronavirus blown ashore by surf spray. It was to dismiss the idea that 6 feet is some magic distance beyond which the coronavirus won’t venture. 

“People infected with a virus can exhale small aerosol particles that do not settle out within 6 ft — they can float around for hours. Note these are emitted into the air without coughing,” Prather explained. “Right now, there is a large fraction of people that are infected and do not have any symptoms. So, if they are surfing or running along the beach, they could be exhaling tiny infectious aerosol particles.”

Perhaps the best takeaway from both the original Times article and Prather’s social media post is this: coronavirus, when attached to invisibly-tiny water droplets, can travel much farther than six feet, no matter where or how it gets onto those droplets or into the air. 

So, to breathe a little easier when you’re outdoors or anywhere else among people, cover your face."

   The Pentagon was aware of the likelihood of a pandemic brought on by a novel coronavirus years ago, predicting with startling accuracy shortages of masks, hospital beds and ventilators that could occur in an outbreak, according to a 2017 internal document reported by The Nation.
   The 103-page document — which the magazine describes as an update to an earlier Defense Department pandemic influenza response plan — cites a novel respiratory illness as the ""most likely and significant threat"" in a pandemic situation. 
   The documents also warns that shortages of masks and ventilators would have a ""significant impact on the availability of the global workforce."" 
   ""The intelligence community and the military were well aware of what could, and unfortunately, did happen"" said Nation reporter Ken Klippenstein in an interview with NPR's All Things Considered. 
   Klippenstein reports that he obtained the document from a Pentagon official who requested anonymity. Klippenstein says the Pentagon has not responded to his requests for comment on the story. 
   Klippenstein told All Things Considered that within intelligence circles, a coronavirus has been viewed as a likely threat going back at least five years. And while President Trump has said the  current COVID-19 pandemic ""came out of nowhere,"" Klippenstein says it is ""inconceivable that the White House did not receive this,"" referencing information contained in the 2017 Pentagon report. 
      Klippenstein adds,"" The threat of a highly transmissible pathogenic virus that targets this respiratory system, this was appreciated for at least the last 10 years."" 
   The ""USNORTHCOM Branch Plan 3560: Pandemic Influenza and Infectious Disease Response,"" as the document is titled, mentions past coronavirus outbreaks, including the MERS outbreak. The document notes that coronvavirus infections are also quite common worldwide. 
   Though unclassified, the Pentagon plan is an internal document intended to foresee the causes of and potentials hurdles to arise in a pandemic situation. It outlines scenarios that may arise during a global outbreak and options for how the military might respond. Within the document are also references to classified materials that could provide additional support to its conclusions.
   The report's conclusions have foreshadowed many of the concerns currently being voiced by both elected officials and medical professionals over hospitals beds and medical equipment. 
   One section reads: ""even the most industrialized countries will have insufficient hospital beds, specialized equipment such as mechanical ventilators, and pharmaceuticals readily available to adequately treat their populations during clinically severe pandemic.""

Guests typically don’t pay for the wedding.
Due to the coronavirus outbreak, many events involving a large number of people have been postponed or canceled, including weddings. This obviously could cause a lot of problems, but one couple apparently expected guests to pay for the wedding and the rescheduling costs.

      A couple who postponed, then canceled, a wedding because of the coronavirus reportedly demanded their guests pay the rescheduling costs.

According to a post on Reddit’s forums by a user named Spidercactus56, his brother’s wedding originally was scheduled for this weekend, but “due to obvious reasons, they’ve had to postpone it.” The user wrote that people were upset because the bride and groom had expected everyone to pay for the wedding and were raising the costs -- after guests already paid for the original date.
“They didn’t organize a cheap wedding neither, it was a $92k wedding,” the post read. “With the amount of friends and family going we would all had to have paid $600 each.”
According to the user, “A lot of people kicked off and either declined to go or refused to pay. The amount we had to pay rose from $600 to $1,800 pretty much overnight. This is just for one person, not even a plus one.”
COUPLES SAY 'I DO' DURING THE PANDEMIC: 'TOMORROW IS NOT GUARANTEED'
The author of the post wrote that while the payment issue caused some issues, his father paid for everyone’s piece of the wedding (although he said everyone eventually paid his father back).
“So. To now. The wedding was canceled,” the post continued, referencing the ongoing coronavirus. “Naturally there was a huge drama from my brother and his equally as entitled/narcissistic girlfriend. If they reschedule the wedding it will cost them another $10k to rebook everything.”
Apparently, the couple expected the guests to pitch in even more money to pay the difference in rebooking fees.

“My brother’s girlfriend called an emergency meeting to discuss the wedding,” the post continued. “They stated they refuse payment from my dad again (apparently we are the entitled ones because he paid for us the last time). If we refuse to pay this time it will be our fault the wedding is ruined blah blah blah. My $1,800 share is now $2,000.”
One Reddit user pointed out, “You aren't... ‘guests’ you are sponsors. If he wants payment, then you should get a say in everything - the wedding gown, the decor, the bridesmaids' dresses, the menu, the booze, everything.”

Another user added, “Nope. Don't cave. Screw them. I'll tell you right now that marriage is not going to last long because once people stop giving them what they want they're going to take it out on each other.”
“How absolutely ridiculous and disgusting of them to expect people to PAY to attend their wedding,” another wrote. “And I bet if they don't get expensive gifts they'll flip.”"

Boeing says it will continue its shutdown of production indefinitely at its Seattle area facilities due to the spread of the coronavirus

2 min read



SEATTLE -- 
Boeing said Sunday it will continue its shutdown of production indefinitely at its Seattle area facilities due to the spread of the coronavirus.

The company in an email to Washington employees said it is extending the planned two-week shutdown rather than reopening Wednesday. The decision affects about 30,000 of Boeing’s 70,000 employees in the state.

The company said the decision is based on the health and safety of its employees, assessment of the coronavirus spread, supply chain concerns and recommendations from government health officials. 

“The health and safety of our employees, their families and our communities is our shared priority,” said Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stan Deal. “We will take this time to continue to listen to our incredible team, and assess applicable government direction, the spread of the coronavirus in the community, and the reliability of our suppliers to ensure we are ready for a safe and orderly return to operations.”

A spokesman told         The Seattle Times that employees are receiving their regular salaries during the two-week shutdown, but will have to transition to vacation or sick leave after that. 

The company said that at the end of the day Friday, it had 133 confirmed cases among employees worldwide, up from 118 a day earlier. Of those, 95 employees are in Washington.

Washington state has 7,666 confirmed cases of the virus and 322 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally on Sunday afternoon.

The coronavirus mainly is spread through coughs and sneezes. For most people, it causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death."

The Malayan tiger named Nadia had developed a dry cough along with six other tigers at the Bronx Zoo, and all are expected to recover.
“We tested the cat out of an abundance of caution and will ensure any knowledge we gain about COVID-19 will contribute to the world’s continuing understanding of this novel coronavirus,” the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Bronx Zoo said in a statement.
“Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers. It is not known how this disease will develop in big cats since different species can react differently to novel infections, but we will continue to monitor them closely and anticipate full recoveries.”

According to the press release, the tiger was infected by a person who was taking care of the animals who was either asymptomatically infected with the coronavirus or had not yet developed symptoms. Now the zoo is saying they’re taking “appropriate preventive measures” for all staff members who are caring for the tigers and the other cats “to prevent further exposure of any other of our zoo cats.”
“We are grateful for the cooperation and support of the New York State Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University and the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, where the initial COVID-19 testing of samples from the tiger were performed,” they said in the statement.
The US Department of Agriculture also confirmed the news in a statement, saying “there is no evidence that other animals in other areas of the zoo are showing symptoms.”
“USDA and [the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] are monitoring the situation and working to support the state and local health departments and state animal health officials. State animal and public health officials will take the lead in making determinations about whether animals, either at this zoo or in other areas, should be tested for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. USDA will notify the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) of this finding,” the USDA said in the statement.
The USDA said despite the fact that there haven’t been other reports of pets having the coronavirus in the US, people who are sick with COVID-19 should limit their contact with animals until more is known about the virus. “
“Anyone sick with COVID-19 should restrict contact with animals, out of an abundance of caution including pets, during their illness, just as they would with other people,” the statement read. “If a sick person must care for a pet or be around animals, they should wash their hands before and after the interaction.”"

On Friday, New York City banned its schools from using Zoom after determining the platform wasn't private and secure enough. Like organizations and individuals around the world, the district had turned to Zoom to remotely carry on its business during coronavirus-necessitated social distancing orders.

However, in recent weeks, Zoom's data collection practices, lack of security and encryption, and multiple other vulnerabilities, came to light. So now, its prominence as the quarantine video chat tool of choice is in question.

In addition to the NYC Department of Education's actions, other districts are reexamining their use of the platform, too. Even the FBI issued a warning about ""Zoombombing,"" the coordinated practice of crashing online classes and meetings and broadcasting inappropriate or offensive content.

In the past, major online privacy scandals have had an underwhelming effect on the public's actions.

The Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed the extent of data Facebook (and other tech giants) collect on its users and monetize through targeted advertising; today, Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram continue to gain users. Amazon-owned Ring is a privacy disaster, delivering data to law enforcement and snooping on users; sales of Ring cameras actually tripled in December 2019. Throughout 2019, reports surfaced on every company that makes smart speakers that the devices are were in some way listening to our private conversations; by the end of 2019, sales of smart speakers still reached a record high.

But now, apparently, the act of breaking into our streamed, visual digital gatherings is the privacy violation egregious enough to get authorities and individuals alike to actually care about online security.

Under social distancing orders, video chats have had to take the place of our in-person interactions. The fact that those classes, therapy sessions, and family catch-ups could be Zoombombed or otherwise exploited has prompted action in ways that other security flaws have not.

Zoom itself has put in place more privacy protections that should prevent against Zoombombing, including changing the default settings to password protect meeting and enable waiting rooms for participants. It has issued a series of apologies for other privacy blunders, such as a vulnerability that let hackers steal Windows passwords and its practices of mining data from LinkedIn and sending data to Facebook.

That does not appear to be enough for superintendents who are trying to enable online learning while also protecting the privacy of their charges. The New York City Department of Education has recommended that schools use Microsoft Teams for virtual class instead.

Protecting your online privacy can sometimes feel like an impossible task on an internet that runs on the use of personal data to sell things. But a compromised video call puts the issue into focus in a way that other scandals haven't.

As our world relies on the virtual realm for connection while social distancing, hopefully that attitude can impact our privacy on the rest of the web, too."
