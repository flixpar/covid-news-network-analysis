Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump and other government agencies over a lack of preparedness, with some going as far to say the administration is downplaying the seriousness of the virus.   Pressed by Tapper about Trump Jr's claims that Democrats ""seemingly hope"" Americans will die from coronavirus to hurt the President in the November election, Pence said it is ""understandable"" the President's son would want to respond to the criticism.  ""As the President said, this is no time for politics. And frankly, I think that was Don Jr.'s point. That there has been some very strong rhetoric directed at the President by some members of Congress..,"" the vice president said. ""But responding to the kind of things that have been hurled is understandable."" Pence continued, ""But what the President's charged us to do, in my conversation with Speaker Pelosi, with Senator (Chuck) Schumer, my conversations with Republican and Democratic governors, is to set the politics aside on this and to work the problem. And I want to assure your viewers, that's exactly what we're doing."" Tapper noted that Republicans have also chimed in with negative comments toward Democrats over coronavirus. Pence interjected, ""Well, look, what I am telling you is that this is really a time for us to come together."" Rep. Ted Lieu called for Pence, who was appointed to oversee the coronavirus reponse, to resign from his role for defending Trump's son's ""shameful comments."" ""Dear @VP Pence: You need to resign from your coronavirus position with your shameful defense of shameful comments,"" the California Democrat tweeted Sunday.  Former Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday slammed the Trump administration's response.  ""We knew that this was coming. Back as far as January. They didn't even begin to prepare the testing kits. I mean, this is something that's kind of elementary. We talked about testing kits, we're now going to get them,"" Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called the administration's response ""opaque and often chaotic."" At a rally in South Carolina Friday, the President accused Democrats of ""politicizing"" the virus, saying, ""This is their new hoax."" Asked Saturday if he regretted calling the virus outbreak a hoax, Trump insisted that he didn't.  ""Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody,"" Trump said of administration critics. ""I'm not talking about what's happening here, I'm talking about what they're doing."" Trump said the criticism was a ""continuation of the hoax,"" and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment. ""I don't like it when they are criticizing these people and I don't like it,"" he said. ""That's the hoax I'm talking about."" "

""The Louvre cannot open this Sunday, March 1,"" a statement from the Louvre said. ""Museum staff met to discuss the health situation and the Covid-19 prevention measures taken by the museum following instructions from the competent authorities.""  It's not clear when the home of Leonardo DaVinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and a half million other pieces of art will reopen.

France, like many countries around the world, is scrambling to contain the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,900 people and infected over 85,000 worldwide since December.  At least 100 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus have been reported in France, including two deaths.  On Saturday, the French government issued an order canceling all public gatherings of more than 5,000 people within confined spaces. That forced the cancellation of the Paris Half Marathon on Sunday, but the directive did not apply to the Louvre Museum.

""We knew that this was coming. Back as far as January. They didn't even begin to prepare the testing kits. I mean, this is something that's kind of elementary. We talked about testing kits, we're now going to get them,"" Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" after being asked about the administration's response.  There had been a strain on testing capabilities since novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States in January. In the early weeks of the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was the only facility in the US that could test for the virus. Since then, coronavirus test kits have been shipped to labs across the country, but some produced inconclusive results. The CDC said it would remake parts of the test kits, and Vice President Mike Pence told Tapper on the same program Sunday that more than 15,000 kits have been mailed to state and local clinics. ""Look, I don't want to talk down the possibility of us being able to do this well, but, you know, the idea that Donald Trump said just several days ago this was a Democratic hoax. What in God's name is he talking about?"" Biden added Sunday. ""Has he no shame?""  The President said at a rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now ""politicizing"" the virus. ""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,"" Trump said. ""They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa."" On Saturday, Trump clarified that he doesn't think coronavirus itself is a ""hoax,"" but the criticism is. Asked if he regretted calling it a hoax during Friday's rally, Trump said he didn't. The comments from Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, come hours after he won the South Carolina primary in a critical victory that has provided a much-needed boost for his campaign. ""I know what I would have done differently and what we did in the Ebola crisis,"" Biden told Tapper. ""I heard Vice President (Mike Pence) say they set up an office in the White House. We had an office in the White House. We, after -- us dealing with the pandemic that could have been incredibly dangerous and affected the world, Ebola, we set up an entire mechanism of how the deal with future outbreaks of pandemic diseases. They eliminated that office when they came in play.""  ""They cut the funding for CDC ... they tried to cut the funding at, you know, in terms of (the Department of Health and Human Services). And so, what, look, here, we knew that this was coming. We knew this was coming,"" Biden told Tapper. President Donald Trump announced Sunday new screening procedures for coronavirus. The President tweeted that people will be screened for coronavirus upon arriving in the US if they are traveling from high-risk countries. In a rare Saturday news conference, the administration also announced new travel restrictions following news of the first US fatality from the disease. The patient died in Washington and appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, who spoke alongside the President at a briefing Saturday. Biden said Sunday that the Trump administration, which has placed Pence in charge of the White House's response, should ""let the scientists speak, and let them tell us what is going on and let them prepare us.""  ""What are we doing? Why are we just getting started? I would have not have dismantled the organization that we put in place in the first place,"" he said, adding that he would've made sure American scientists were sent to China and European countries to gather information about the spread of the disease.

The President will also visit the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, on Tuesday, according to the White House. That trip will also be related to the effort against the coronavirus. Administration officials weighed having Trump visit the CDC weeks ago, but he never followed through on the initial plans, the official said. It's unclear if Vice President Mike Pence, who was recently placed in charge of the administration's response to the outbreak, will join the President on the trip. Politico first reported Trump would be making the trip to the CDC. The visit comes as Trump has fumed in recent days at Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  Messonnier recently said of a potential outbreak in the US, ""It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen."" Trump thought officials like Messonnier were causing unnecessary alarm over the disease, which claimed the life of a man in Washington this weekend, marking the first US fatality.  The now-deceased patient appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, who spoke alongside the President at a briefing Saturday.

And he wasn't alone. ""I'm Vice President Mike Pence,"" Bennett said. ""Most of you know me from the sentence 'Even if Trump was removed, we'd still be stuck with Mike Pence.'""  Bennett's Pence then explained that President Trump had put him in charge of combating the coronavirus, ""even though I don't believe in science."" ""And I have to admit, this disease has been quite the test of my faith,"" he said. ""Just like dinosaur bones."" He then took questions from the White House press pool. The first question came from Mike Bloomberg, who was played by Fred Armisen. ""What are you doing here? How'd you get past security?"" Bennett's Pence asked.  ""Well, I just walked in coughing and everybody got out of my way,"" Armisen's Bloomberg responded.  Then, he asked Bennett's Pence if it seems ""like a good time to have a president that's competent and capable"" even if that candidate lacks charisma and the ability to connect with human beings? Sen. Elizabeth Warren, played by Kate McKinnon, popped up from behind a podium to torment Armisen's Bloomberg. ""Did you really think you were going to get away from me that easy?"" she said. ""This is my job now. I follow you around and make your life a living hell. I might be fifth in the polls, but I'm No. 1 in your nightmares."" This led this week's host, John Mulaney, to join the conversation as former Vice President Joe Biden.  ""Now, listen, folks, if we want to fight 'China cough' we got to be smart,"" he said. ""We got to make sure to get new teeth daily."" Mulaney's Biden was then interrupted by Sen. Bernie Sanders, played by Larry David.  ""You got to admit, folks, universal healthcare doesn't sound too crazy now, does it?"" David's Sanders said. McKinnon's Warren then told the crowd to make sure that they use Purell hand sanitizer. ""No, no, no, no, no! No Purell,"" David's Sanders said. ""I got a bottle of that junk and on the label it said, 'it kills 99.99% of germs. What happens to the top .01%?!

Shincheonji director denies responsibility for South Korea coronavirus infections,2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/asia/shincheonji-director-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-intl-hnk', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/26/asia/shincheonji-south-korea-hnk-intl/index.html']"," (CNN)The director of the religious group at the center of South Korea's novel coronavirus outbreak has denied responsibility for the recent spike in infections, saying authorities were trying to ""exaggerate"" its involvement to shift blame. Kim Shin-chang, director of international missions for the Shincheonji religious group, told CNN Sunday that members had been fully transparent and cooperative with authorities in trying to contain the outbreak. The coronavirus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected 3,526 people and killed 17 in South Korea.  Health authorities say more than half of all cases are related to Shincheonji -- an offshoot of Christianity -- and a specific branch in the southern city of Daegu. South Korea's Ministry of Justice last week said that 42 Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus originated, to South Korea since July. Many of the cases in other countries came from people who had traveled to Wuhan, or had been in contact with someone who had -- meaning the 42 members could have brought back the virus if they were traveling during the peak of the outbreak. Kim told CNN there were 357 Shincheonji members based in Wuhan. He said that while the group didn't have official travel records for all its members, ""we have no record"" of any coming from Wuhan into South Korea since November. He said the outbreak began in December -- so there was no need to check members' travel history from July. ""It makes me wonder if they are trying to exaggerate the link or possibly move the responsibility to Shincheonji,"" he said. ""I would like to ask the Ministry of Justice why they did not check all Chinese and Korean citizens (traveling) from Wuhan since July, and why they only released the number of 42 (Shincheonji) members."" The Ministry of Justice said it had pulled the immigration records from July on request of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). CNN has reached out to KCDC for comment. 'We did our best in the situation' After identifying and announcing the Shincheonji link on February 18, South Korean authorities raced to contain the spread of the virus, tracking down thousands of attendees to trace their contacts and symptoms. It took a week before the group gave a list of member's names to authorities. About 600 Daegu police officers were deployed to knock on doors, track phones, and scour security camera footage to find them, as members often don't answer phone calls from nonmembers. Daegu's mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said Friday that the group had also omitted some members in a list of attendees submitted to city authorities, and that he would report the group to police for ""hampering the city's measures to contain the virus."" Kim apologized ""to the Korean people for the worries we have caused"" -- but insisted Shincheonji had been fully transparent. ""We shut down all offices to prevent further spread, and our administrative process has become delayed as all members are working from home so they can self-isolate themselves to the fullest extent,"" he said. ""I'm sure there have been areas where we could have done better but we do want to emphasize that we did our best in the situation."" Kim also admitted members had been encouraged to deny being part of the group — not to conceal any vital information or to hamper the coronavirus investigation, but because ""Shincheonji is perceived as a cult, and because of this many members are discriminated against."" He dismissed other accusations too, like claims by former member Duhyen Kim that illness was never accepted as a valid reason to miss services. In February, Duhyen Kim described to CNN how, when he was a member, followers would sit on the floor during hours-long services ""packed together like sardines."" He and several other former members described how attendees are not allowed to wear masks during prayer time, as it was seen as ""disrespectful to God."" Such claims were outdated and inaccurate, said Kim Shin Chang, adding that since January, members with symptoms had been told not to come in, or to wear masks during service.  ""So there is no evidence that our service method is the reason we are seeing such an outbreak in our group,"" he said. What is Shincheonji, and how did the virus spread? Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony was established on March 14, 1984. It was founded by Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a god-like figure within the group -- he is even believed to be ""the second coming of Jesus Christ,"" said Duhyen Kim. The virus is believed to have spread through cases who attended a Shincheonji service or were in contact with attendees, authorities say. Between January 31 and February 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral of the founder's brother, who had been hospitalized near the southern city of Daegu.Numerous confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths have since been recorded from the same hospital. Then, on February 18, South Korea reported its 31st case -- a 61-year-old woman with no prior overseas travel history or contact with other confirmed cases. A cluster of infections followed. By February 20, the national tally had increased from 31 to 156 and the first death was reported. While tracing the movements of the 31st patient, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spotted a link between the new patients: case number 31 had attended a Shincheonji service with hundreds others in Daegu. Once the link to the religious group was established, authorities sprang into action, quarantining attendees, disinfecting buildings, and closing down the group's services. The group says it has about 245,000 members in total, with more than 31,000 from overseas. An internal document from 2017, called the ""International Missions Department status report,"" provided to CNN by former members, said the group has eight branches in the US, with the LA chapter being the largest with more than 1,000 members, as well as dozens of chapters in China.

""In addition to screening travelers 'prior to boarding' from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America,"" Trump tweeted Sunday morning. Asked which countries would fall into the ""high risk"" designation, Trump mentioned, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, clarified later Sunday that ""this will be expanded to Italy and South Korea. Additionally we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy, and other European Nations as needed."" Screening was already in place for those traveling into the US who have been in China in the last 14 days. In a rare Saturday press conference, the Trump administration announced the State Department would raise the travel advisory level for parts of Italy and South Korea where the coronavirus has spread widely. The administration also announced expanded travel bans on Iran, another country that the virus has ravaged as it spreads across the globe. Trump and top members of his coronavirus task force have sought to calm fears that sent markets tumbling last week.  Trump on Saturday warned Americans that although more cases are ""likely,"" most healthy people who contract the illness will recover and the risk to the average American remains low. And Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that while the administration knows there will be more cases and that it's possible Americans could die from the disease, ""the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low."" Members of the administration's coronavirus task force -- of which Trump placed Pence in charge earlier this week -- have met frequently as they weigh measures aimed at stopping a wide outbreak in the US.  Pence told Tapper that more than 15,000 testing kits are in the mail to state and local clinics. Officials, though, have warned people against buying masks in preparation for coronavirus, saying doing so could place a strain on the resources health care providers need to provide treatment safely.   Minutes before the President's press conference Saturday, Washington state confirmed the first US death from coronavirus.  The President said Saturday that there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the US. This number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC.

Police departments put out fake warnings about coronavirus contaminated drugs,2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/us/coronavirus-police-test-drugs-trnd/index.html,[]," (CNN)Some police departments are putting out fake warnings that illicit drugs could be contaminated with coronavirus in an effort to make drug arrests.  The Tavares Police Department in Florida and the Merrill Police Department in Wisconsin are among those that have taken to social media offering to test methamphetamine and other drugs. ""If you have recently purchased Meth, it may be contaminated,"" with coronavirus, Merrill Police Department said on Facebook. ""If you're not comfortable going into an office setting, please request any officer and they'll test your Meth in the privacy of your home. Please spread the word! We are here for you!"" ""Bring it by our station and we will test your batch within minutes!"" Tavares Police Department said.  At least 2,976 people have died from coronavirus globally. There are now 71 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of the virus in the United States, including one fatality.  Some people criticized the department's posts online. ""I would rather not see police departments making 'jokes' like this online or posting false information about a pandemic that is already being treated cavalierly by the executive branch,"" Jessica Thill commented on Merrill Police Department's post. ""This would be funnier if addiction (often a maladaptive coping skill formed as a result of trauma experienced in the form of abuse, neglect, abandonment, etc. during vital development stages of the brain during a human being's life) wasn't a disease that devastates individuals, their families, and their communities,"" another commenter, Karriann Elise, said. The post from Merrill police was updated to acknowledge the critical comments it received. But, the department added, similar ploys have worked before and are done with the intention of keeping people safe. ""Just to give you some history, we have actually experienced people report their illegal drugs being stolen, being ripped off in a drug deal, being sold a look-a-like illegal substance, etc.,"" the department said. ""So this attempt, although a long shot, still had some possibility behind it."" ""It is our hope that every drug arrest both works to hold offenders accountable for their deeds and provides them with a path toward treatment options."" Police departments using social media to push fake drug campaigns have caused a stir before. In July, a Tennessee police department warned against flushing drugs down toilets and sinks because it could create meth gators. The post was not meant to be taken seriously, the department said. ""Let us be perfectly clear: the meth gator was a humorous illustration used to highlight the dangers of flushing drugs and other substances down your toilet,"" the Loretto Police Department wrote on Facebook.

But that madness could fade away this year if one players' advocacy group gets its way.  The National College Players Association (NCPA) has asked the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to consider having its men's and women's basketball tournaments with no crowds in the arenas due to coronavirus fears.

""Google just cancelled a summit in California and Amazon is encouraging its employees to avoid all nonessential travel because of coronavirus concerns,"" the statement continued. ""The NCAA and its colleges must act now, there is no time to waste."" The NCPA also called for the NCAA to cancel events where players would be in contact with crowds. ""The NCAA and its colleges should take precautions to protect college athletes,"" the group said. ""Athletic programs should also take every possible measure to sanitize buses and airplanes used to transport players."" In response to the request, the NCAA said it is monitoring developments with the coronavirus outbreak.  ""NCAA staff continues to prepare for all NCAA winter and spring championships, but we are keenly aware of coronavirus and will continue to monitor in coordination with state/local health authorities and the CDC,"" NCAA spokesman Greg Johnson said in a statement. ""The NCAA Sport Science Institute sent two memos recently to NCAA members directing schools and conference offices to Center for Disease Control and Prevention resources on the issue.""

They will deal with a respiratory illness, we'll get them treatment."" The vice president cautioned that the US could experience ""more sad news."" ""But for people that have other conditions that would militate toward a worse outcome that, we could have more. We could have more sad news,"" Pence said. ""But the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low."" Pence's comments come after the Trump administration announced new travel restrictions following news of the first US fatality from the disease. The patient died in Washington and appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who spoke alongside the President at a briefing Saturday. Pence said at the briefing that the US would be expanding travel restrictions from Iran ""to include any foreign national who has visited Iran within the last 14 days."" He also said the US would heighten a travel advisory for specific regions of Italy and South Korea. ""We are urging Americans to not travel to the areas in Italy and the areas in South Korea that are most affected by the coronavirus,"" Pence said. CNN's Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report."

Sources said a deal could be announced over the next day, setting the stage for swift approval by both houses of Congress. It still remains to be seen how much the deal will be worth. But the sources said it could exceed $7 billion, a level far higher than the $2.5 billion White House request. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $8.5 billion to deal with the outbreak. President Donald Trump announced Sunday new screening procedures for coronavirus. The President tweeted that people will be screened for coronavirus upon arriving in the US if they are traveling from high-risk countries. The Trump administration announced on Saturday new travel restrictions following news of the first US fatality from the disease.

NASA images show a decrease in China's pollution related to coronavirus shutdown,2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/world/nasa-china-pollution-coronavirus-trnd-scn/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk', 'https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk', 'https://www.epa.gov/no2-pollution/basic-information-about-no2#What%20is%20NO2', 'https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146362/airborne-nitrogen-dioxide-plummets-over-china']"," (CNN)Satellite images released by NASA and the European Space Agency reveal that air pollution over China has gone down since the coronavirus outbreak.  Production in many factories has been halted and transportation has been restricted to prevent spreading the virus. In mainland China, tens of thousands of cases have been confirmed with more than 2,700 dead. From January 1 to 20 the images show higher levels of nitrogen dioxide over China, but from February 10 to 25, traces of the gas are hardly visible. Nitrogen dioxide is a yellow-brown gas emitted by motor vehicles, power plants, and industrial facilities. It can cause respiratory problems like coughing, asthma, and difficulty breathing. NASA scientists say the drop was initially most visible over Wuhan, where the outbreak began. ""This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,"" said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said in a statement. Pollution does tend to go down around the Lunar New Year as many businesses close for celebrations, however, researchers believe this decrease is more than just a holiday or weather-related effect.  ""This year, the reduction rate is more significant than in past years and it has lasted longer,"" Liu said. "

First death from coronavirus in the United States confirmed in Washington state,2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/08/us/coronavirus-saturday/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-28-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'http://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2020/American-Airlines-Update-on-China-Flights-OPS-DIS/default.aspx?utm_source=News_Alert&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Newsroom_Alerts', 'https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/policy-diagnostics-testing-laboratories-certified-perform-high-complexity-testing-under-clia-prior']"," (CNN)A patient infected with the novel coronavirus in Washington state has died, a state health official said Saturday, marking the first death due to the virus in the United States.  The patient was a man in his 50s who had underlying health conditions, according to Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington. County health officials became aware of the case on Friday, he said. ""I want to assure that family they are on the hearts of every American,"" Vice President Mike Pence said in a press briefing Saturday. There was no evidence the patient had close contact with an infected person or a relevant travel history that would have exposed the patient to the virus, said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at the White House Saturday, suggesting the patient became ill through community spread. While this is the first death in the United States from the coronavirus, it is not the first death of an American. A 60-year-old US citizen died earlier this month in the city of Wuhan, China, where the virus first appeared in late December. President Donald Trump and US officials previously said in a press briefing that the patient was a woman. A senior administration official later blamed the mix up on Redfield, who tweeted later Saturday that the ""CDC erroneously identified the patient as a female"" during a briefing with Trump and Pence. US officials urged Americans not to panic.  ""We respectfully ask the media and politicians and everybody else involved not do anything to incite the panic, because there's no reason to panic at all,"" Trump said. ""It's important to remember,"" Azar said, ""for the vast majority of individuals who contract the novel coronavirus, they will experience mild to moderate symptoms, and their treatment will be to remain at home, treating their symptoms, the way they would a severe cold, or the flu."" The US is expanding travel restrictions in response to the coronavirus, Pence said.  The administration is expanding existing travel restrictions on Iran to include foreign nationals who had visited Iran in the last 14 days, the Vice President said. The US will increase travel advisories for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 — the highest level — advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries. Officials investigating Washington nursing facility Three new presumptive positive cases were announced in Washington state on Saturday, meaning a test given by a state or local lab came back positive, but has yet to be confirmed by the CDC's lab in Atlanta. Among those three cases was the patient who died, health officials said.  The other cases are both affiliated with Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, Duchin said. One case is a health care worker, a woman in her 40s, who is hospitalized in satisfactory condition. She had no relevant history of travel.  The other case is a woman in her 70s who was a resident of the center. She is in serious condition in another hospital.  State health officials are aware of a ""number of individuals who are ill"" with respiratory symptoms or pneumonia, at the facility, Duchin said, and officials are investigating this as an outbreak. More than 50 residents and staff from the facility will be tested, Duchin said. Life Care Center of Kirkland is monitoring its residents and associates, executive director Ellie Basham said in a statement.  ""We take the event very seriously and have members of our corporate clinical team en route to provide extra assistance,"" Basham said. The facility is in contact with state health officials and the CDC.  A woman who said her elderly father lives at the facility told CNN that the center's staff called her Saturday, asked her not to visit at this time and said her father was being tested for coronavirus.  The woman, who asked not to be named, said she was informed earlier in the week that her father had a cough. She was told Saturday that he was still doing OK.  ""If he was worsening, they would let me know,"" she said. ""They've always been great about that. If anything is wrong, they call me."" The woman and her father have always been happy with his treatment at the facility, she said. Now her concern is whether her father has the coronavirus. After hearing multiple people at the facility exhibit troubling symptoms, she wondered if all will be diagnosed with the same thing.  ""So then what happens?"" she said. ""Does everybody just kind of stay there, and the whole place becomes its own quarantine thing? I don't know."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee issued a state of emergency after the increase in cases. The proclamation directed state agencies to use ""all resources necessary to prepare for and response to the outbreak.""  Multiple cases without a relevant travel history There are now at least 71 confirmed or presumptive positive coronavirus cases in the United States, the CDC said Saturday.  These include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people repatriated from China and 24 cases that occurred in the US, according to the CDC. The 24 cases across the US are in Arizona, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin.  Of those 24, 13 cases are travel-related, and 10 are linked to person-to-person spread, according to the CDC.  The person-to-person cases include several of unknown origin, including: • A woman in Washington County, Oregon, who is presumptive positive. She is in isolation. • A high school boy in Snohomish County, Washington, who is presumptive positive. He's doing well, according to Dr. Chris Spitters, interim health officer for the Snohomish Health District. • An older woman in Santa Clara County, California, who tested positive. • A Solano County, California, woman who is in serious condition at UC Davis Medical Center. Another Santa Clara County case was confirmed Saturday, according to the county's Public Health Department. This patient, the fourth in the county, was described as an adult woman and a ""household contact"" of the older woman. A patient in Illinois was diagnosed with coronavirus, according to a joint press release from the Illinois and Cook County health departments. The test results conducted on this patient in Illinois produced a presumptive positive for COVID-19, the release said, which means the results have to be confirmed by the CDC.  The presumptive positive patient is hospitalized in isolation, the release said. Illinois has already had two previously confirmed cases of coronavirus and both patients made a full recovery, the release said.    The virus has so far killed at least 2,976 people, including 2,870 in China. There have been 86,500 confirmed cases.  American Airlines announced Saturday they were suspending flights from Miami and New York to Milan, Italy, effective March 1, according to a travel advisory from the airline. Flights to Milan will resume April 25. Customers who have had their flights canceled and do not want to rebook can request a full refund through the American Airlines website. Officials work to expand testing capabilities Duchin, the health officer for Seattle and King County, said new cases could have been identified earlier if not for the delays in local testing capability and restrictive criteria about who gets tested.  The patient who died was identified after the state lab acquired the coronavirus test kit. The patient was newly eligible for testing because of ""very recent criteria that were put out by the Centers for Disease Control that our health care providers became aware of,"" Duchin said. Testing guidelines were broadened by the CDC earlier this week after the first case of unknown origin emerged in California. She wasn't initially tested because she did not fit the CDC criteria for testing at the time. Additionally, some testing kits initially sent to state and local labs were flawed, delaying their ability to test for the virus.  ""This has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Friday. The CDC hopes to have every state and local health department testing for the coronavirus by the end of next week, Messonnier said in a press briefing Friday.  In hopes of enabling more rapid testing capabilities, the US Food and Drug Administration announced  Saturday it would allow certain labs to use tests they developed and validated before the FDA has reviewed them. The guidance only applies to labs that are certified to perform high-complexity testing. Once labs have validated a test, the guidance says, they must notify the FDA and submit a request for emergency use authorization within 15 business days.

How health officials and social media are teaming up to fight the coronavirus 'infodemic',2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/tech/coronavirus-social-media-reliable-sources/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-01-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200202-sitrep-13-ncov-v3.pdf', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/tech/facebook-twitter-google-coronavirus-misinformation/index.html', 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FB&source=story_quote_link', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/tech/facebook-twitter-google-coronavirus-misinformation/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/health/coronavirus-who-public-health-emergency-international-concern-declaration/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/29/tech/coronavirus-misinformation/index.html', 'https://about.fb.com/news/2020/01/coronavirus/']","New York (CNN Business)As health officials in a growing number of countries fight to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, they're also working to stem a secondary issue that the World Health Organization is calling an ""infodemic.""  The WHO defines an infodemic as ""an overabundance of information — some accurate and some not — that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it."" The problem is aided by the ease and speed with which false or misleading information can spread on social media.  Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, emerged in China in January and now has spread to more than 85,000 global cases with infections on every continent except for Antarctica. As the disease has spread, so too have false claims online about how it began, the number of people infected and promises of magical cures.  ""In this particular case, with COVID-19, because of the growth of social media platforms in recent years, information is spreading faster than the virus itself,"" Aleksandra Kuzmanovic, social media manager for the WHO, told CNN's Brian Stelter on ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday. In an effort to help people sort through the sometimes overwhelming amount of information online, Kuzmanovic said the organization is working directly with social media companies to ensure users are directed to trusted sources. Now, when social media users on a number of platforms, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, search for ""coronavirus,"" they are directed first to information from either the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control or their national health ministry.  The WHO is also working to produce information in a range of languages as the outbreak spreads around the world. But as digital misinformation campaigns become increasingly sophisticated, the WHO and other world health officials should be doing more, said Seema Yasmin, director of the Stanford Health Communication Initiative and a former officer with the Centers for Disease Control's Epidemic Intelligence Service.  ""We've seen the spread of rumors and anti-science messages during Ebola, during Zika,"" Yasmin said. ""The anti-vaccine movement is not new, and WHO's response often has been, 'Oh, there's a really bad outbreak of measles in Eastern Europe, it's okay, we're going to disseminate pamphlets.' That's not enough when the anti-science messages are sophisticated, targeting vulnerable populations and really tailoring anti-science messages to groups that believe them."" Yasmin urged news organizations to put resources toward doing health and science journalism and encouraged health officials to be proactive in fighting the ongoing issue of health misinformation online.  Some social media platforms have independently taken further steps to curb misinformation and panic surrounding coronavirus.  Facebook (FB) said several weeks ago it would remove content with bogus cures or other false claims about coronavirus or posts that could create confusion about where accurate information can be found.  The company will ""remove content with false claims or conspiracy theories that have been flagged by leading global health organizations and local health authorities that could cause harm to people who believe them,"" Kang-Xing Jin, Facebook's head of health, said in a blog post published the same day the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a public health emergency. Last week, a Facebook spokesperson told CNN Business that the platform is working with its fact-checking partners to debunk false claims about the virus. Once Facebook posts and links are fact-checked and found to be false, the spokesperson said, the platform ""dramatically"" cuts their distribution. People who see this content, try to share it, or already have, are alerted that it's false. The company also says it will prohibit ads related to coronavirus that are misleadeing or aimed at profiting off of the panic surrounding the outbreak.  ""For example, ads for face masks that imply they are the only ones still available or claim that they are guaranteed to prevent the virus from spreading will not be allowed to run on our platforms,"" the company said in a blog post.  Those efforts point to a shift in Facebook's response to false information on its platform in recent years, according to Steven Levy, editor-at-large for Wired magazine and author of the new book, ""Facebook: The Inside Story.""  ""In 2015, some people tried really actively to get them to take down the (anti-vaccination) stuff and it did not resonate with them,"" Levy said. ""They weren't dealing at all with the concept of what we now call 'fake news.' But now they're much more sensitive."" However, Levy pointed out that the company's reaction is still often dependent on public opinion.  ""What seems to happen is that when there's enough of an outcry, when Facebook's practices are exposed, you know, people say, 'Wow this can't happen,' Facebook will step in and say, 'I guess we have to make an exception for this.'"" Facebook declined to comment for this story.  "

He co-hosts the podcast ""Words Matter."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN)Ranking high among the President's powers and responsibilities is the job of communicator in chief. In times of triumph and clear and present dangers, the public looks to the President for cues on how to act, what they should feel and what they should do.   In the aftermath of the Challenger explosion in 1986, people shared grief and were reassured by President Ronald Reagan's address to the nation.  George W. Bush grabbing the bullhorn at ground zero in 2001 reminded the country that together we would all get through this tragedy. For Bill Clinton, it was the Oklahoma City bombing response, and for Barack Obama, his powerful speech and song in Charleston, South Carolina, in the aftermath of the shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. And yet for every powerful moment, there are as many misses. George W. Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" in Iraq and in 2005 his quote to the embattled FEMA director after Hurricane Katrina, ""Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job,"" created a political hole that Bush 43 never quite climbed out of. And in the midst of a serious economic crisis in the late 1970's, Jimmy Carter's ""malaise"" speech hit all the wrong notes for rebuilding confidence in America's economy. The point is that communicating matters. Words and optics make a big difference, not only politically, but in solving whatever crisis faces the country. President Donald Trump faces one of those moments right now with the spread of the coronavirus. To date, he's done almost everything wrong. He has consistently underplayed the potential for a serious public health crisis here at home. Worse, he has made a series of off-the-cuff remarks on a complicated scientific problem that has undermined the work being done both at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Compounding the problem is his apparent emphasis -- too often -- on the economy and the stock market instead of the public health issues. Is there anyone who really doubts by now that for Trump his own political fortunes, which are tied to economic and market performance, take precedence over protecting the health of all Americans? But that approach has failed spectacularly because the markets are looking for the same thing the public wants and needs -- reassurance that there is a plan in place to deal with the potential pandemic. Making matters even worse, Trump has made this a political football by going after the Democratic leaders in Congress and not contradicting conservative commentators who are making outrageous claims about Democrats rooting for the virus to spread to gain political advantage. Trump went as far as to say Friday night at a rally in South Carolina that coronavirus is the Democrats' ""new hoax.""  Like all Presidents before him, his ability to govern (and in Trump's case, be reelected) will be judged by his performance during crisis in the next weeks and months. There are several steps he should take immediately that will both help solve the problem and boost his political standing. First, he must stop speaking off the cuff.  His comments have ranged from uninformed to the ridiculous. Saying things like, ""A lot of people think that (the virus) goes away in April ... as the heat comes in,"" undermines his ability to be the communicator in chief.   Since we know he won't stop tweeting, he should use that platform to put out sound and vetted advice on what average Americans can do, what they should worry about and what they shouldn't. In any crisis, the person or organization that consistently delivers accurate and useful information controls the narrative. The President is uniquely positioned to fill that role. Second, it's right to coordinate all information through a central source, with the White House being the logical place. But to be effective, you have to provide information through briefings on a regular basis.  A communications team drawn from the medical community needs to brief the press every day. Flood the zone with information, become the trusted source of what people need. Let the political and legislative people be involved where appropriate, but let the experts drive the information flow. Information, not spin, is the way forward. It's not a zero-sum game. You don't win by proving you're better than your political opponents. You win by winning the public's trust to solve the problem Third, Trump should suspend or scale back the political activities of the administration. It was a terrible look this week as the President simultaneously sought to calm the country and markets while meeting with social media personalities Diamond and Silk and other right-wing leaders as part of the CPAC conference. The Vice President putting off his first task force meeting until after the same divisive political conference also didn't help.  The President should not be running around the country holding rallies and should not be using the bully pulpit to castigate Democrats on this important issue. Bring the Democrats in, make them part of the solution. In the end, it's the President who will get the lion's share of the credit -- and the blame. Fourth, optics matter, optics reassure. The President needs to be seen directing the massive resources of the federal government that are arrayed against the spread of coronavirus. It's not enough to be solving the problem, the President needs to provide evidence that the government is doing everything it can, and he is the force driving the process. And it's not just optics.  The President, through his public actions, has a unique ability to actually activate and drive the response. Put simply, when the President says we are going to do something, the government responds. Fifth, he needs to be straight with the American public. People want to know how serious the problem is, what is being done and what they can do about it themselves. They don't want platitudes and will severely penalize any politician who pretends there is no real problem when everyone knows there is.   It runs against all elements of Trump's makeup, but a little humility, honesty and rolling up of the sleeves -- doing the work of government and being seen doing it -- would go a long way. These are not the times for self-congratulation and claiming that only one man can solve the problem. It's a potential crisis that will force Trump to act differently if he hopes to survive politically. Finally, the economy is based on fundamentals and perception and emotions. Trump needs to level with the American people about the impact of the virus. Bragging about how strong we are runs counter to what people are seeing. Acknowledge the pain this virus will cause, and be clear about what the government can and can't do. Remember what Bush 43 said in the aftermath of 9/11: We will need to change the way we fight terrorism, but if everyone stays home and doesn't go out and spend and live, the terrorists have already won. It is unlikely the President can grow into this model overnight. But his reelection may depend on it, given the far-ranging impacts of a possible pandemic. President Clinton had a simple credo that he followed consistently: Good policy always makes good politics. President Trump would be wise to follow that advice. "
Florida governor announces two cases of novel coronavirus in the state,2020-03-02,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/us/florida-coronavirus-two-cases-trnd/index.html,['http://www.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/03/030120-two-presumptive-positive-covid19-cases.pr.html']," (CNN)Two cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Florida, according to state officials. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis updated the conditions of the two Florida residents in a press conference Monday. The first patient is a man in his 60s who is hospitalized in Manatee County, the governor said. That individual has pneumonia and is in stable condition at a hospital. He did not travel to any areas impacted, so it's unclear how he contact the virus. He's currently in isolation. The second patient is a woman in her 20s in Hillsborough County. That individual recently returned from northern Italy. She is in stable condition and remains in isolation at home.  ""Despite these cases, the threat to the overall public remains low. With that said, we do anticipate that more will test positive and we have taken additional action to help contain the virus's spread,"" he said. DeSantis said a total of 23 people in the state have been tested. The state is currently monitoring 185 cases, and almost 800 have been monitored in total. In a second press conference Monday, DeSantis also urged places with high amounts of senior citizens, like assisted living facilities or nursing homes, to take precautions. Senior citizens, especially those with underlying conditions, are among the most vulnerable to the virus. ""I mean, to let somebody come in who had just come back from Italy, who has symptoms, would be a huge mistake,"" he said. ""We certainly are concerned given our demographics ... if those folks are not watching whose coming in, then you could end up seeing this virus transmitted and then that would not be good."" The Florida Department of Health will continue to update details on the virus on its website. "

California officials confirmed a case in Sonoma County, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 20 -- with most concentrated in Santa Clara County.  Eric Kurhi, a spokesman for the Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters, told CNN that the county is following guidelines, which include ""keeping hands clean"" and encouraging individuals who are sick to stay home.  Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race ""The Registrar of Voters is providing each vote center with hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes to use on the touch screen machines that we have,"" said Kurhi.

Jacquelyn F. Callanen, a spokeswoman for Bexar County election department, said the county, which includes San Antonio, is expecting a ""smooth Election Day"" as they have given election officials guidance  ""Our poll sites we met with them, we talked with them, they all have hand santizers themselves. There's no panic here. We are looking for a smooth election tomorrow,"" Callanen said.  Over 2 million ballots have already been cast since early and by-mail voting opened on February 18, according to the Texas secretary of state's office.

The virus has now been reported on every continent except Antarctica.  Concerns about the virus have also spread across the world. We asked you for your questions about coronavirus. Here's some of the ones that have been asked the most: What are the symptoms of coronavirus? The novel coronavirus, a cousin of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, has symptoms that include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, possibly a headache and maybe a fever, which can last for a couple of days. For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like pneumonia or bronchitis. How is it treated? There is no specific treatment, but research is underway. Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own, and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing pain or fever medication. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough. Drink plenty of fluids, get rest and sleep as much as possible. Is there a coronavirus vaccine? Scientists are working on a vaccine, but don't expect it anytime soon. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is trying to develop one but says it will take at least a few months before clinical trials start and more than a year until a vaccine could become available. Separately, scientists in Texas, New York and China are also trying to create a vaccine, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But the challenge is daunting, Hotez said. ""The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats,"" he said. Does the flu shot protect me from coronavirus? Dr. Leana Wen, the former health commissioner of Baltimore, said the flu shot doesn't protect people from coronavirus — but that doesn't mean you shouldn't get it. ""The flu, influenza is a separate virus from coronavirus,"" she told CNN. ""And so getting the flu shot does not protect you from getting coronavirus — but it does protect you from getting the flu, which is important because there have been over — there have been tens of thousands of deaths from influenza this season in the US."" Wen urged Americans who have not get gotten a flu shot to get it now. Older people and those with chronic conditions should also consider getting the pneumonia vaccine. Should I be wearing a mask? The CDC does not recommend that people who are well wear face masks. Rather, the CDC recommends to only wear a mask if a health care professional recommends it. A face mask should be used by people who have the novel coronavirus and are showing symptoms — that is in order to protect others from the risk of getting infected. Overall, the use of face masks remains crucial for health workers and people who are caring for someone infected with the virus in close settings, such as a health care facility or at home, according to the CDC. US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams urged people to stop buying masks, noting how crucial they are for health care workers.  ""They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!"" he tweeted. How can I protect myself from the virus? In general, the public should do ""what you do every cold and flu season,"" said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state. That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. The World Health Organization recommends staying at least 3 feet away from anyone who may be infected. If you're the one feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. But don't use your hands. Use either your bent elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately afterward. What can I do to prepare for an outbreak in my area? In terms of supplies, the US Department of Homeland Security recommends on its website that, before a pandemic strikes, to store a two-week supply of water and food, as well as over-the-counter medications you tend to take. ""Have any nonprescription drugs and other health supplies on hand, including pain relievers, stomach remedies, cough and cold medicines, fluids with electrolytes, and vitamins,"" according to the department. Should I cancel my travel plans? Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer.  It's very much an individual calculation, experts say, taking a number of factors — the traveler, their companions, the destination and more — into consideration. In a situation that's unpredictable and evolving quickly, solid information is key.  Pay attention to travel advisories: The CDC and the US State Department are both issuing regular travel advisories for destinations that are significantly impacted by the virus outbreak. Monitor those ""closely and regularly,"" advises Dr. Henry Wu, director of Emory Healthcare's TravelWell Center. Elderly travelers or those who have other conditions should consider that they might be at higher risk for complications of infections, Wu said.

""You can increase your risk of getting it by wearing a mask if you are not a health care provider,"" Adams said during an interview on Fox & Friends on Monday morning. ""Folks who don't know how to wear them properly tend to touch their faces a lot and actually can increase the spread of coronavirus,"" Adams said.  ""We're certainly seeing more spread in communities, but it's important for folks to know that right now their risk as American citizens remains low. There are things people can do to stay safe.

On Sunday, Adams posted on Twitter that people should stop buying masks. Rather, he tweeted that to keep yourself and those around you healthy, wash your hands often, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands and disinfect surfaces. Adams also tweeted on Sunday that if the general public purchases a majority of the facemask supply and if health care providers can't get them to care for sick patients, ""it puts them and our communities at risk!"" Two dozen new cases reported over the weekend The total number of novel coronavirus cases in the United States jumped by two dozen over the weekend, as the first two deaths from the outbreak were confirmed. New cases of the virus were announced in Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state, New York and Florida on Sunday, bringing the US total to 89 as of Monday morning, up from 65 on Friday night. The new cases prompted emergency declarations in at least two states and sparked new warnings. Schools in the Seattle area, Portland area, and Rhode Island all announced closures for cleaning this week after presumptive positive cases linked to either students or staff.

And despite repeated pleas from health officials not to purchase them, Americans can't stop snatching up masks and respirators. The mask boom has prompted sellers to jack up prices and exploit demand. This has meant a shortage for medics who need them.  ""We need to make sure those N95 masks are available for the doctors and nurses that are going to be taking care of individuals that have this illness,"" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield said during a House Foreign Affairs hearing on Thursday.  ""And it really does displease me, to find people going out, there is no role for these masks in the community."" Americans don't need masks. They buy them because they're scared To be clear once again, Americans don't need masks. The CDC says that healthy people in the US shouldn't wear them because they won't protect them from the novel coronavirus. In fact, warns US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, face masks might actually increase your risk of infection if they aren't worn properly. But medical workers who treat patients with novel coronavirus do need them. And, the CDC says, it's crucial that those supplies don't run out.  When it comes to hysteria and panic, though, reason takes a backseat.  ""This is a psychological thing,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told CNN. ""The coronavirus is coming, and we feel rather helpless. By getting masks and wearing them, we move the locus of control somewhat to ourselves.""  Overwhelming demand leads to price gouging Demand for the masks is the highest its been in months. According to data provided to CNN by Helium 10, a software company that assists Amazon retailers, Amazon users have searched for the word ""N95 mask"" more than 862,000 times in the last 30 days. In December, users searched for the keyword a mere 4,500 times over 30 days.  And with overwhelming demand comes inevitable price gouging. The top-selling mask product, a 100-pack of Universal 4533 sanitary dust masks, started selling at $8. The price eventually rose over $200, Helium 10 said.  And even at that price, the product is selling. Or it was -- it's out of stock as of Friday. Some products don't display a box where users can click to purchase it. Helium 10 said this means Amazon removed the sellers because they'd rapidly increased their prices.  In a statement to CNN, an Amazon spokesperson said removal is part of its company policy to discourage price-gouging sellers.  ""Sellers set their own product prices in our store and we have policies to help ensure sellers are pricing products competitively,"" the spokesperson said. ""We actively monitor our stores and remove offers that violate our policies.""  But that doesn't stop people from buying them at elevated prices anyway.  Orders have been canceled due to CDC stockpiling Advice can change, but as of now, there's no guidance telling Americans to wear face masks, either the basic surgical face masks or the N95 respirators that health care workers wear to treat infectious diseases.  This hasn't stopped Americans from stockpiling both types anyway.  David Bowman of Phoenix, Arizona, told CNN he'd ordered three respirator masks, which cost him just under $13 each, from Vitality Medical. The medical supply company guaranteed his order would arrive by March 7 at the latest.  But then it was back-ordered until May 29. The notice Vitality Medical sent him said that the CDC had ""allocated with our warehouse the item [he] ordered.""  ""The CDC just stole my mask,"" Bowman tweeted. ""@CDCgov what gives you the right to steal a mask that I bought and paid for?""  Other customers have received similar messages citing requests from the CDC. ""[I] was more alarmed (and frustrated) just trying to get a mask for myself and a few family members,"" Bowman told CNN in a direct message. ""But I thought the government can only seize products like that in an emergency situation, which they seem to be downplaying it [sic].""  CNN reached out to the CDC to confirm it had allocated Vitality Medical's entire supply of N95 respirators and is waiting to hear back. Vitality Medical told CNN that due to restrictions in place with the CDC, all of the N95 respirators on its site were out of stock.  Mask shortages mean fewer available for health workers Health care workers who treat novel coronavirus patients are at the highest risk in the US for disease transmission, said Dr. Peter Hotez, Baylor College of Medicine professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine.  ""That has the potential to be the most destabilizing part of this epidemic,"" Hotez said. ""Even a single death among health care workers ... could make the whole thing unravel.""  Preliminary studies suggest as much. In a paper published in the medical journal JAMA earlier this month, 40 health care workers in Wuhan were diagnosed with novel coronavirus after treating patients who had it.  ""We have to absolutely make sure that every single hospital in this country has adequate PPE [personal protective equipment, which includes gloves, masks, face shields, coats and gowns],"" he said. ""It's not clear that that's the case.""  Though federal and CDC officials have said there's no reason to panic, their concern is mounting -- and increasingly public. Earlier this week, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said there were 30 million N95 respirators in the National Stockpile. The US needs about 10 times that amount to adequately supply health care workers, he said.  ""The overwhelming priority right now is to ensure that all of our hospital frontline staff, clinical staff, have that level of protection,"" Hotez said. ""'Cause if they go down, there's going to be nobody.""  Chinese Americans buy masks for families overseas For the East Asian diaspora in the US, buying masks while they're still available is a necessity for family members abroad. Surgical masks and respirators have been sold out for weeks in the areas where outbreaks are ballooning. Stefanie Yu, a tech worker in San Francisco, hadn't considered shipping masks to her family in Guanzhong until a friend who'd recently returned from China called her with an urgent message -- buy for your family immediately. ""'Oh, this is happening,'"" Yu remembered thinking. ""Everyone is trying to get masks.""  Every website and major retailer she visited had sold out of every mask. Respirators she clicked open on Amazon were gone within minutes. She finally found a few from a packaging supply company. She bought 50 boxes with two N95 respirators each, which cost her more than $250.  ""Those are disposable,"" she said. ""You're supposed to wear it one time for a couple hours. So it's definitely expensive.""  Shipping was even more chaotic, she said. A company that ships to China sent them on February 7 for $80. Then, about a week ago, the company told her it had returned the masks because no planes were flying to China.  The only other option to get the masks to her family would cost her another $80. She paid it.  She's still not sure if the masks made it -- or whether they ever will.  ""I'm not the only one who's experienced this,"" she said. ""[The company] was seeing a lot of people shipping masks, and according to them, most of the masks got turned back.""  Her family is based in southern China, where the situation is not as severe as it is in Wuhan, where the outbreak originated. Her father still goes on his daily morning run. But every store there is sold out of masks and will be for the foreseeable future.  ""I think lots of Chinese people who have overseas resources to buy masks and ship it back will do that,"" she said.  Christina, who lives near San Jose, California, is an ""overseas resource"" to her nine immediate family members in Hong Kong. She asked to be identified by her first name to maintain her privacy.  She ordered 1,800 face masks for $222 -- ""pretty good price"" -- from Staples in January. A few days later, her sister in Hong Kong called -- friends in the US had had their orders canceled. A few days later, Christina's order was canceled, too.  The company didn't explain why -- just that they lacked supply, she said.  Christina placed orders with five other companies. All of them were eventually canceled or back-ordered. She eventually gave up on online shopping.  ""I visited so many stores,"" she told CNN. ""Walmart, Rite-Aid, Target, even grocery stores and dollar stores. Every place was sold out.""  Over two days, she visited 15 stores and found just one box of 20 masks.  So she started getting to stores early. She'd stand outside in line for 30 minutes or more ahead of opening, when she knew stores were restocking their inventory. In January, she was usually the first in line. But now that it's nearly March, the lines are longer and supplies are dwindling. ""Every [store] I go in, the masks are all gone, the sanitizers are gone, alcohol wipes are gone, the gloves are gone,"" she said. ""When you go in the store, you'll know which section it is when you see a big gaping hole with nothing on the shelves."" Xenophobia against Asian Americans persists  Recently, Christina stood in line in front of a local hardware store a half-hour ahead of its opening. She peeked inside and saw masks on display. Then she heard the manager yelling to the employees who were opening up.  ""'They're here for masks; don't let them get more than one,'"" she said she heard him say. ""'Careful, they're going to come back and try to get back in line again.'""  When she got inside, she found a pack of three child-sized masks. She asked the manager if there were any larger sizes.  ""He sees I'm holding a pack and said, 'You're already holding one item,'"" she said. ""He got really peeved.""  He asked Christina how many children she has. Two, she said. He told her three masks should be plenty.  ""He said, 'You guys keep coming for these. Leave some for the US people,'"" Christina told CNN. ""I was like, 'I can't believe what I'm hearing.'""  Disgusted, she left without buying any masks. The manager said they'd be gone by the end of the morning anyway.  ""At first, when I started looking for masks, people were really understanding,"" she said. ""But now, when I go up and ask, and I'm Asian, I can feel the look on their face. It's this fed-up look, like 'Oh, they're going to ask for masks again.'""  CNN's Alice Yu, Fernando Alfonso III and Michael Nedelman contributed to this report. "

Andrew Cuomo warned that the spread of novel coronavirus to New York was imminent.  ""You can't have it in this many cases on the globe, and in this many places in the country, and it not be in New York,"" the governor said.  His prediction came true. On Monday, Cuomo said the state's first coronavirus case is a 39-year-old health care worker who had recently returned from Iran -- a country with almost 1,000 cases of coronavirus and at least 54 deaths from the illness.  He described the illness as the ""flu on steroids."" The woman was tested at Mt. Sinai hospital in New York City, which was notified before the patient's arrival, Cuomo said.  She's now in home isolation with her husband, who's also a health care worker and is being tested for the disease.  The woman did not have any symptoms of illness when she flew back to the US last Tuesday, officials said. But authorities are contacting people on her flight and the driver of the private car service she used to get to her Manhattan home.  The woman has not used public transportation since she came back to the New York, Cuomo said.  He said the goal now is to ""test as many as you can"" and then isolate anyone who tests positive to help reduce the spread. ""We will have more cases, we will have community spread. That is inevitable,"" Cuomo said.   But he said there's no need to panic.  ""You can't let the fear outpace reality,"" he said.  ""Put this in perspective. This is not the first time we've dealt with this situation. We had H1N1, we had the swine flu, we had the avian flu, we went through Ebola, we went through MERS, we went through SARS. We've dealt with this before."" Cuomo said the mortality rate with this virus is higher for senior citizens and those with compromised immune systems. ""And that's where we need to focus our efforts,"" he said.  The governor also announced the state will institute a new cleaning protocol at schools and in the public transportation system to help stop any potential spread of the virus.   But New Yorkers shouldn't let coronavirus hold them back from normal daily activities, said Oxiris Barbot, commissioner of the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.  ""There's currently no indication that it's easy to transmit by casual contact,"" Barbot said. ""There's no need to do any special anything in the community. We want New Yorkers to go about their daily lives. Ride the subway, take the bus, go see your neighbors.""   CNN's Mirna Alsharif contributed to this report. "

As of Monday afternoon, the emergence of the illness at the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, had left four residents dead and others hospitalized, local health officials said. A health care worker also has been hospitalized. In total, Washington state has reported six deaths, so far, officials said. Officials previously said , of the nursing home's 108 residents and 180 staff members, more than 50 have shown signs of possible Covid-19 infection, the name given to the illness caused by the novel coronavirus which emerged from Wuhan, China, late last year. Visits from families, volunteers and vendors have been halted and new admissions have been placed on hold, according to a statement from Ellie Basham, the center's executive director. ""Current residents and associates are being monitored closely, and any with symptoms or who were potentially exposed are quarantined,"" she wrote. Nursing homes at heightened risk The cluster of illness is the first of its type in the US, where 2.2 million people live in long-term care settings and may be at heightened risk because of age and underlying health conditions. ""We are very concerned about an outbreak in a setting where there are many older people,"" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, health officer for the Seattle and King County public health agency. The American Health Care Association, which represents 13,500 nonprofit and for-profit facilities for seniors and disabled people, issued updated guidelines Saturday in response to the Washington outbreak. The new virus is thought to spread primarily via droplets in the air, and the guidelines largely echo strategies recommended to stem the spread of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza. They include ifrequent hand sanitation among staff and visitors, grouping people who become ill in the same room or wing and asking family members who are sick to avoid in-person visits. But members had been anticipating cases of the new virus, said Dr. David Gifford, AHCA's chief medical officer and senior vice president of quality and regulatory affairs. ""Clearly, it signaled that it's here and that what people knew was likely to come is closer to them than before,"" he said. Coronavirus numbers The coronavirus has been confirmed in more than 85,000 people worldwide and led to nearly 3,000 deaths, including the first U.S. death reported Saturday in another Washington state man in his 50s. That man was not associated with the Kirkland nursing center, officials said. Studies of hospitalized patients in China suggest the median age of infection is in the 50s and that about 80% of Covid-19 cases are mild. However, a new summary in the journal JAMA reported that the virus has a case fatality rate of 1% to 2% overall — and as high as 8% to 15% in older patients in China. That is alarming news for US residents in long-term care settings where illnesses caused by more common pathogens, such as the norovirus and seasonal influenza, often spread rapidly, causing severe complications. Immune response wanes as people age, leaving them more vulnerable to infections of all types. Dr. Karl Steinberg, a geriatrician who serves as medical director for two nursing homes and as chief medical officer for a chain of 20 others in Southern California, said the news of Covid-19 cases at the Washington state nursing center is worrisome. ""That's very scary,"" Steinberg said. ""It worries me that once it gets going, it will be really hard to control the spread."" The situation may be akin to the spread of the coronavirus on cruise ships, such as the Diamond Princess that was quarantined off the coast of Japan, with one key exception, Steinberg said. People on cruise ships can be confined to their rooms with minimal interaction with staff and fellow residents. People in nursing centers are there because they need help with activities of daily living, he noted. Handling sick patients In the Washington state center, Duchin said, officials are advising health workers to separate cohorts of sick patients from those who remain well and to don personal protective gear, including eye protection, to avoid infection. ""It's a very challenging environment with so many vulnerable patients to manage an outbreak,"" he said. Duchin urged older people and those with health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes to pay close attention to precautions, such as washing hands frequently, keeping hands away from their faces and avoiding people who show signs of illness. Just-released guidelines from the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine call for increasing hand hygiene, isolating infected patients and making plans to ensure that health care workers stay home if they're sick. The guidelines also call for screening visitors and daily temperature checks for residents and staff. Individual centers should remain in close contact with local health officials about appropriate actions, Gifford said. Authorities — and families — should think carefully before taking steps such as removing patients from nursing centers during an outbreak. ""Evacuating a facility is not a benign event,"" he said, noting that moving can be traumatic to frail and elderly people. Community spread of virus The nursing home cases are examples of community transmission of the virus, meaning the patients did not have a known history of travel to other nations where the virus is spreading or contact with a traveler diagnosed with the illness. Community transmission has now been detected in multiple states, including California. However, Seattle researchers reported late Saturday that new genomic analysis suggests the virus may have been spreading in Washington state since mid-January, when a 35-year-old Snohomish County man who had visited Wuhan, China, was confirmed as the first U.S. case of the infection. ""This strongly suggests that there has been cryptic transmission in Washington state for the past 6 weeks,"" tweeted Trevor Bedford, a computational biologist at Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, who is tracking the virus. He estimated there could be ""a few hundred"" infections in the state. At least 70 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed or presumed positive in the US, and officials with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Americans should expect to hear more reports of illness in the coming days and weeks. The new Washington cases and the first reported US deaths were identified only after the CDC expanded the definition of who could be tested for the virus and after states and hospitals were given more leeway and supplies to conduct their own tests. ""What that says to us is that as we test more, we're more likely to find cases of the disease,"" Duchin said. A team from the CDC has been sent to help local and state health officials investigate the Life Care Center outbreak. ""We have a large investigation ahead of us, a complicated investigation ahead of us,"" Duchin said. In the meantime, Steinberg said he and others will take precautions to prevent the possible spread of Covid-19 cases in long-term care settings and act swiftly to contain them, if necessary. ""I guess there's not much to do but hunker down and hope it's not too bad,"" he said.

It's likely there are more coronavirus cases in the United States than the numbers show,2020-03-02,https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/health/coronavirus-uncounted-cases-community-spread/index.html,"['https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1699845974/michael-s-phillips', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html', 'https://health.ucdavis.edu/team/pediatrics/497/dean-blumberg---pediatric-infectious-diseases-sacramento', 'https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2566/justin-lessler', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/health/us-coronavirus-test-kits/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/profiles/john-bonifield']"," (CNN)If you show up at NYU Langone Health in New York City with a fever and a cough, they're going to assume you have the novel coronavirus.   ""We don't care if you've traveled to us from China or from Queens, we're going to put a mask on you,"" said Dr. Michael Phillips, an infectious disease specialist at NYU.   The New York University doctors and other experts are convinced there could be more novel coronavirus cases in the United States than have been officially announced. The number of cases in the US increased to 89 as of Monday morning, up from 65 on Friday night.  Several factors, such as testing delays and the fact that the virus can spread before an infected person shows any signs, have led them to this conclusion. Recent US cases of coronavirus support that theory.   While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been focused on finding coronavirus among travelers from China and their close contacts, on Wednesday it announced the first US case with an unknown origin. The patient hadn't traveled to China and had no known exposure to someone with coronavirus. Since then, more cases of unknown origin have been identified in the United States. ""That suggests that the virus is out there in the community, and that means pretty much that everybody's at risk,"" said Dr. Dean Blumberg, an infection disease specialist at UC Davis Medical Center, where one of the California patients is being treated, told CNN affiliate KCRA. ""We don't know who might be carrying it. We don't know who we can get it from.""  'An interesting and complicated problem' Early on in the outbreak, Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Justin Lessler started to think along the same lines as the NYU doctors.   Lessler's team wondered: Could there have been cases of coronavirus in the US even before the first case in the country was announced on January 21?  They took a look at a calendar.   The first known case of coronavirus anywhere in the world occurred in Wuhan, China, on December 8. For the next six weeks, people flew out of Wuhan and surrounding cities, until China locked down the area on January 23.   Lessler's team set up a computer model to look at that time period and found that most likely about four people who were infected with coronavirus -- but possibly as many as 10 - traveled from Hubei province to California during this time. They looked at California because that's the state expected to bear the largest brunt of the outbreak.   Lessler calls these estimates ""very rough"" and emphasizes that this is just modeling.  But if their model is right, and even one infected traveler entered California unnoticed during this time, he or she might have spread the disease to others.   ""It's an interesting and complicated problem,"" said Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.   Looking for coronavirus in the community  The CDC knows there could be cases of coronavirus they might have missed. That's why they've set up surveillance labs in five cities -- Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and New York City -- to look for cases. These labs, which routinely check patient specimens for flu, will start checking for coronavirus in specimens that test negative for flu.   The surveillance plan was announced about two weeks ago, but it's unclear if it's started because there's been a delay in distributing lab kits. The CDC said Friday that more state and local labs were coming online for testing in the next few days. While experts say the surveillance could show there's spread beyond the known cases, they also say they don't believe there have been large, undetected clusters of coronavirus without anyone noticing.   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said it's ""unlikely"" that there are ""entire cohorts"" of coronavirus cases that no one's picked up on.   For example, he said someone unknowingly infected with coronavirus might have gotten off a flight from China and taken an Uber home. He said it's possible the Uber driver became infected and wasn't officially counted as a case, but he doubts that the driver started a large chain of transmission.  ""We could have missed one or two cases, but not entire cohorts,"" Fauci said.  Ron Klain, who served as Ebola czar under President Obama, said the United States may not have found cases of coronavirus here ""because we haven't looked.""  ""We haven't really tested extensively. We don't know how widespread it is. If you don't test, you're not going to find it,"" Klain told CNN's Jake Tapper on Thursday. ""I think what's clear is however many cases there are here now, there are going to be more."" Why coronavirus cases might go undetected Experts say there are several reasons there could be unidentified cases of coronavirus in the US.   First is that early cases might have been missed, as demonstrated by the Johns Hopkins model.   Secondly, some people with coronavirus have no symptoms, or are just mildly ill. Even someone coming off a flight from coronavirus hotspots such as China, Italy or South Korea might attribute feeling slightly ill to something besides coronavirus.   ""That's human nature,"" NYU's Phillips said. ""They're going to think -- maybe it's the airplane food. I'm going to get better.""   Thirdly, some people traveling into the US from these hotspots might intentionally deny feeling sick because they don't want to be isolated in a hospital for two weeks. If they're on a flight from China, and they know they'll be checked for fever when they land in the US, they could take Tylenol or Advil to mask the fever.   ""Being a suspicious New Yorker, I'm like, 'Prove it to me that people aren't going to do that,' "" Phillips said.   And finally, so far 12 people have traveled through US commercial airports and were later found to be infected with coronavirus. For a period of time, these travelers were symptom-free before they were diagnosed.   It's known that someone can spread coronavirus even before they develop symptoms. But health authorities have not routinely traced back all the contacts a person had before they became ill, so it's possible that some of them were missed and spread the virus.   For all these reasons, experts say there could be cases that we're missing.  ""Anyone would be foolish to say it's not possible,"" said Dr. Arthur Reingold, head of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Four of the new cases, including the second death, are among residents of a long-term nursing facility where officials have been investigating a possible outbreak of coronavirus.  The second death was a man in his 70s who died Saturday, Seattle & King County Public Health said in a release. A fifth case was reported in Snohomish County, the county's health department said in a release. The five new cases are presumptive, meaning they have been tested positive by a public health lab and are pending confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In all, 13 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the state, including a man whose death was reported Saturday, making him the first coronavirus fatality in the United States.  The 13th case reported late Sunday is a man in his 40s. He is in critical condition, the health department said. The other three new cases reported Sunday are a woman in her 80s, a woman in her 90s and a man in his 70s. All have underlying health conditions and are in critical condition. Two other cases were confirmed by Seattle and King County Public Health officials earlier  Sunday. They are both males in their 60s with underlying health conditions. One is ""in critical but stable condition"" at Valley Medical Center in Renton. The other is in critical condition at Virginia Mason Medical Center, a news release said. ""This number is expected to rise as more people are tested and results confirmed,"" according to a news release from the health department. However, the two new coronavirus cases are not linked to the long-term health facility where the other coronavirus cases were identified, Katie Ross, a spokeswoman for Washington Health Department, told CNN. The other cases are a high school boy, a woman who traveled to South Korea and an unidentified man.  Nursing home case The cases associated with the Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, include a 40-year-old female health care worker who has no known travel outside the US.  She is in satisfactory condition at a local hospital, officials said. The second one, a woman in her 70s, is hospitalized in serious condition.  More than 50 residents and staff from the Life Care Center in Kirkland are experiencing symptoms, and will be tested for coronavirus, said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County.  ""In addition, we're aware of a number of individuals associated with the long-term care facility who are reportedly ill with respiratory symptoms or pneumonia, and we're in the process of investigating this situation as an outbreak,"" Duchin said. ""We're in the beginning stages of our investigation."" In a statement, the facility said it's not allowing visits from families, volunteers or vendors, and is also placing admissions on hold for the time being.  ""We are now in the process of working with the long-term care facility, with the support of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" Duchin said. ""And we're in a process of providing support to that facility to care for the infected patients, to protect the uninfected patients, and to provide infection control."" Bonnie Holstad, whose husband Ken is staying at the Life Care Center after a fall caused a broken hip, was outside the facility Sunday, trying to get information about her husband's condition. Her husband, who has Parkinson's disease and dementia, had a cough, and the center was not answering phone calls, Holstad said.  So, she made a sign and stood outside the glass front doors of the facility. ""No one at Life Care is answering the phones,"" the sign read. ""He needs to be attended to ... what is his temperature?"" A nurse did go down to check on him, she told CNN, and Holstad was told he doesn't have a fever. He's not being tested for the virus, she said, because he doesn't have all symptoms required for testing.  ""I was so angry. How can this be that I have to do this, make a sign and go down there?"" Holstad said.  ""I'm very worried for my husband,"" Holstad said. ""He's one of the vulnerable people,"" because of his age and his Parkinson's disease. ""I have real problems with how they're handling the interface with family,"" she said, remarking it was ""sort of like a movie about an epidemic in a little town, and they don't know how to handle the situation."" CNN emailed the Life Care Center on Sunday about Holstad's husband but did not receive a response. Holstad said when she was there Wednesday, she noticed staff members wearing masks. She was told that was because some residents had colds. On Saturday, when she arrived with sandwiches to have lunch with her husband, there was a sign on the door that visitors weren't allowed. It wasn't until she got home and listened to a voicemail from the center that she knew about the coronavirus there. It's not just the question of his care, Holstad said, but also the fact that family members aren't given any information on what they should be doing after being in contact with the center's residents. Nine family members had visited her husband this week, she said.  High school boy had flu-like symptoms The high school boy in Snohomish County became ill with flu-like symptoms last Monday, the student's family said in a statement.  He was tested for the flu, but the tests came back negative, so he returned to Jackson High School on Friday, the county health district said in a blog post.  He stayed on campus about five minutes and went home because the family was notified by health officials that his original sample had been tested for coronavirus and came back presumptive positive, the health district said.  ""The family didn't know their son was being tested for COVID-19.... Like most people, they assumed it was the flu. They did all the right things,"" the health district said.  The high school  was closed over the weekend and will be closed Monday to allow for a thorough cleaning and disinfecting before the students return.  District health officials say they are investigating this case since it suggests that local transmission of COVID-19 is occurring.  ""Our team is still in the midst of the investigation, so we do not yet know the possible source of infection,"" said Dr. Chris Spitters, health officer for the Snohomish Health District.  Hazen High School in the Seattle suburb of Renton will be closed Monday after a student and parent reported having flu-like symptoms, the school district's superintendent, Damien Pattenaude said in a Facebook post Sunday.  The student hasn't been to school since falling sick Wednesday. Along with the parent, who works in the health care industry, the student is self-quarantined at home.  Both have been tested the virus and are awaiting the results. Custodial staff have been mobilized ""to begin thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting Hazen,"" the post said. State of emergency in Washington state Elsewhere, the Lake Washington Institute of Technology will be closed Monday and Tuesday after a nursing faculty member and 16 nursing students were at the Life Care Center late last week, said Dr. Amy Morrison, the institute's president. It's also canceling all large community and college events this week, Morrison said in a statement. In nearby Redmond, seven medics are being quarantined after possible exposure to the virus and ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the Redmond Police Department tweeted Sunday, without giving details on the possible exposure. In Kirkland, 25 firefighters and two police officers that responded to calls at the facility have been placed under quarantine out of an abundance of caution, according to a statement on the city of Kirkland's website. ""The first responders under quarantine had responded to calls for various medical complaints at the Life Care Center, one of which resulted in a patient being transferred to Evergreen Hospital,"" the statement says. ""Firefighters are either under home quarantine or are utilizing a Kirkland fire station for quarantine."" Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency Saturday, directing state agencies to use all resources necessary to respond to the outbreak. ""This will allow us to get the resources we need,"" Inslee said. ""This is a time to take common-sense, proactive measures to ensure the health and safety of those who live in Washington state."" There are now at least 85 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in the United States and two deaths. They include 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people repatriated from China and 38 cases that occurred in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. Following a brutal week, stocks in Asia pushed higher Monday on hopes that central banks and other policymakers will come to the rescue of a global economy at serious risk from the novel coronavirus outbreak. The Bank of Japan said in an unscheduled statement that it would provide ""ample liquidity"" to ensure stability in financial markets. That follows the Federal Reserve's commitment on Friday to ""act as appropriate to support the economy."" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also said Monday that he will speak to his G7 counterparts by phone this week to coordinate their responses. China is expected to roll out a big stimulus package at some point, too. But questions remain about how much policymakers can really do to mitigate the coronavirus shock to the economy and markets — raising the possibility that any stabilization in risky assets will be short-lived. S&P 500 futures are now trading in the red. ""While we expect the policy cavalry to arrive soon, central bank easing may have a more limited ability to address this type of real economic shock,"" Zach Pandl and Kamakshya Trivedi of Goldman Sachs told clients on Sunday. Put another way by Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, a currency broker: Even if the Fed cut interest rates to zero, the European Central Bank pushed interest rates further into negative territory and the Bank of Japan stepped up monetary stimulus, it would do little to restore public confidence. The problem isn't access to cheap money, but the growing health crisis. ""Will these measures encourage you to buy a new [apartment], a new car or even a new iPhone? ... Are you likely to consider expanding your business given the cheap liquidity? Most likely, the answer is no,"" he said Monday. Central banks also have far less ammunition to deploy than they did a decade ago. Interest rates remain at or near record lows, and the balance sheets of many central banks remain swollen from years of bond purchases. The ECB and BOJ might have to get creative — an experiment that would unfold in real time. Just in: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that the coronavirus is plunging the world economy into its worst downturn since the global financial crisis, and that growth could be cut in half this year if the outbreak continues to spread.  It cautioned that a ""swift and sizable"" fiscal response is necessary to supplement action by central banks as some reach the limits of what they can do. The global travel industry under serious strain The travel industry has already taken a huge hit due to travel restrictions and canceled trips tied to the coronavirus outbreak. But for a vital sector of the global economy, responsible for roughly one in 10 jobs, it's likely just the beginning. My CNN Business colleague Chris Isidore reports that the travel industry is facing what could be its worst crisis since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. ""It's on the front line of the fallout,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody's Analytics, told Chris. ""It's the most directly and immediately impacted."" That's clear from the recent stock performance of companies in the travel business. In a recent note to clients, Goldman Sachs pointed out that some of the worst performing industry groups since the US market peaked last month are airlines (down 22%), hotels (down 19%) and casinos (down 19%). The investment bank observed that consumer worries about coronavirus are likely to persist as negative sentiment sets in. ""No one rings a bell when a contagion ends, so a near-term reversal of behavior seems unlikely,"" chief US equity strategist David Kostin said. An activist investor is targeting Twitter's Jack Dorsey Activist investor Elliott Management built a stake in Twitter and is pushing for changes, including the replacement of CEO Jack Dorsey, according to multiple news reports. Elliott has amassed a stake of more than $1 billion, per Bloomberg, and has nominated four directors to the company's board. Among its reported concerns: The firm is worried that Dorsey splits his time between Twitter and payments platform Square, where he also serves as CEO. Dorsey has also said he could spend up to six months of the year working in Africa at a time when the platform seems to be moving a slower pace than other social media companies. Twitter's stock has dropped more than 6% since Dorsey, who co-founded the company in 2006, returned as CEO in 2015. Facebook's stock has risen roughly 121% during the same period. Shares of Twitter are up more than 4% in premarket trading. Up next JD.com (JD) reports results before US markets open. Tilray (TLRY) follows after the close.

Millions of students in China, Japan, Vietnam, Mongolia, Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Italy and elsewhere have been impacted by school closures in recent weeks in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus.  And fears of an outbreak in the United States have already prompted a handful of school closures in the Northwest, including at Jackson High School in Snohomish County, Washington, where a boy tested positive for the coronavirus. The school will be closed Monday for cleaning. An elementary school in Lake Oswego, Oregon, will also be closed through Wednesday for cleaning after an employee tested positive. That came after Bothell High School outside Seattle closed for cleaning when a staffer's relative was tested for the coronavirus. That test ultimately came back negative.  But it could be a sign of what's to come, and now, school districts are preparing for the possibility their own communities will see confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Here's how they're getting ready. Many are focused on prevention and communication ...   Schools and districts across the country have said they're in touch with their state and local health departments, which will advise school officials on best practices and next steps as the the outbreak goes on.  Much of what school officials have said is common sense and applicable not just to Covid-19 -- the World Health Organization's name for the disease caused by the coronavirus -- but also to a more familiar threat: the flu.  The coronavirus is spreading ""at a time when school nurses are already dealing with the flu season,"" said Donna Mazyck, executive director of the National Association of School Nurses. And like they would every flu season, schools and nurses are focused on promoting prevention, Mazyck said.  Those prevention methods include the basics, such as washing your hands for at least 20 seconds several times a day and staying home when you're sick. Students and teachers should avoid touching their eyes, noses or mouths to keep from spreading germs, and schools should wash and disinfect high-touch surfaces such as doorknobs and desktops.  Communication -- not only with health officials but with students and families as well -- is critical, Mazyck said. School nurses in particular can help alleviate unnecessary anxiety, she said, especially when families have the news on repeat.  ""Children respond to that,"" she said. Students and families should get the facts, she said. But it's important to keep ""the conversation on what we can do rather than perseverating on information that doesn't change but can cause fear."" ... and reviewing response plans Additionally, school districts are working to review and update their infectious disease response plans, Mazyck said.  Schools often already have these plans in place, Mazyck said. The 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic prompted many schools to review and implement some protocols, but these plans are often reviewed for flu season. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a planning checklist specifically for school administrators, Mazyck said.  If a sick student does come to the nurse's office, he or she will do what they always do. The nurse will check the students' symptoms before referring them to their primary care provider, Mazyck said.  ""They'll also note whether those symptoms are matching those related to Covid-19 exposure,"" she said. That information would likely be shared with the local health department, she added. School closures are possible ... Some schools may be forced to implement social distancing in an effort to prevent an outbreak. In a classroom setting, that could mean spreading students out. A 2017 CDC document suggested dividing classes into smaller groups and rearranging desks so students were at least 3 feet from each other. But social distancing could also mean isolating a sick student or closing a school entirely.  ""The key here is to isolate individuals who are infected to protect others from getting it,"" said Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association.  ""And that's where schools have a problem,"" he added. ""Classrooms are basically incubators for viruses."" These decisions would be made with the help of health authorities, he said, who have knowledge and expertise that district superintendents will lean on, particularly when or if a case is identified in a school. ""Those are difficult decisions that need to be made in conjunction with health organizations,"" Domenech said.  School closures are generally decided based on a percentage of absenteeism among staff and the student body, Mazyck said. But officials will take a variety of factors into account before closing a school. ""You'd look at disease severity,"" she said. ""That's how many people are sick, what's going on in that community where schools are located and in the school itself.""  ""And then decisions are made based on the impact of disease on the school staff and the students we may feel like are vulnerable or maybe at higher risk for Covid-19,"" she said.  ... but so is online schooling The possibility of closures also raises questions about how schools can continue teaching students without a prolonged interruption.  One of the benefits unavailable at the time of the 2009 H1N1 flu epidemic is today's technology, Domenech said. Many school districts have laptop computers for students to take home, he said, making it easier for them to continue their learning online.  Miami-Dade County Public Schools announced earlier this week it has as many as 200,000 electronic devices it can distribute to students in the event of school closures.  ""If we have to shut down a school for any reason -- and that's a measure of last resort -- or isolate classrooms of students where they would have to stay home, we are able to empower those students and families with devices with digital content so their education continues from a distance,"" Miami-Dade Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said.  Of course not all neighborhoods and school districts have the resources Miami-Dade has, and students may not have reliable access to the internet or a computer to learn online.  In many of those cases, Domenech said, schools will prepare instructional packets -- ""The old paper and pencil, if you can imagine,"" he said -- for students to take home.  There will be challenges Closures could be difficult for parents, Domenech said, who would likely have to stay home with students or have someone else stay home, because sending them to daycare would defeat the purpose of a school closure.  Students from low-income areas might also rely on school meal programs for meals. But school districts' emergency response plans likely include an alternative, such as connecting with community groups that can help, Mazyck said. ""I saw that happen during the H1N1 epidemic and pandemic,"" Mazyck said. ""Because those school administrators know their populations, they made provisions for children who would be missing their food because schools had to close for health reasons."" Districts will likely keep these challenges in mind, but ultimately containing the coronavirus will win out.  ""Some of these decisions are going to be tough and going to be hard,"" Domenech said. ""But again, if we're talking about an epidemic and containing the spread of an epidemic, those are the things that are going to have to happen.""

The company said in a statement that it has ""always required sellers provide accurate information"" on product pages and removes those that violates its policies. Amazon said that third-party sellers must follow its Fair Pricing Policy, which states companies can't set a price ""significantly higher"" then seen in other places or sell an item that ""misleads customers.""  The removal comes after Wired found sellers gouging the prices of coronavirus-related products, like face masks, or charging people ""exorbitant shipping costs,"" according to the magazine. In one instance, the publication found a seller with face masks for as much as five times their normal price.  ""We are disappointed that bad actors are attempting to artificially raise prices on basic need products during a global health crisis and, in line with our long-standing policy, have recently blocked or removed tens of thousands of offers,"" an Amazon (AMZN) spokesperson told CNN Business. ""We continue to actively monitor our store and remove offers that violate our policies."" Third-party sellers on Amazon have come under criticism in the past for selling defective or fraudulent products with little oversight.  Fear has also gripped consumers as the coronavirus continues to spread. Major stores, like CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA), warned last week that there might be shortages of disinfectant products like hand sanitizers and cleaning wipes. There are now more than 88,000 coronavirus cases around the world. It has killed more than 3,000 people, with the vast majority being in mainland China. "
CDC hasn't revealed information to doctors that would help coronavirus patients,2020-03-02,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/coronvirus-patient-research-cdc/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk', 'https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191', 'https://www.cdc.gov/sars/clinical/index.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/clinicians/index.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/index.html', 'https://ncdp.columbia.edu/about-us/faculty-and-staff/', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html', 'https://www.chop.edu/doctors/offit-paul-a', 'https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191', 'https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/arthur-l-caplan']"," (CNN)As new cases of coronavirus arise daily in the United States -- including several announced over the weekend and one death --  the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has failed to release crucial information physicians say could help save the lives of Americans diagnosed with the novel coronavirus.      Several US patients have recovered from coronavirus, but so far, the CDC has shared detailed clinical information about only one of those patients. That information includes what treatments the patients received and how they fared.   The CDC is the federal agency that communicates with physicians about how to handle outbreaks. Whether it's SARS, Ebola or last year's measles outbreak, the agency uses information from cases around the world -- and in particular the United States -- to advise doctors on how to diagnose, evaluate and treat diseases. The federal agency possesses such information about several US coronavirus patients, but has not released it. That means doctors who now unexpectedly find themselves treating new coronavirus patients aren't able to benefit from the findings of doctors who preceded them.     ""It's a medical truism that it's absolutely essential that physicians with experience with a particular condition disseminate information to others,"" said Dr. Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University.    Not sharing such information is ""is inexplicable and inappropriate,"" Redlener added.     The CDC did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.     The top infectious disease expert at the National Institutes of Health said he thought the information would be shared soon.     ""There will be reports,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases. ""I'm sure that ultimately we're going to put the cases together and report them. That's what we do in medicine all the time.""     Little advice from US doctors    But infectious disease doctors say they can't understand why the information hasn't already been shared, considering that many of these patients recovered weeks ago.     The CDC has guidance on its website for physicians who might find themselves treating coronavirus patients, but that advice relies almost entirely on papers published by researchers in China.     Infectious disease experts say while that information is valuable, it would also be useful for doctors to know details about what happened to the US cases.    ""If you're a doctor dealing with this in the emergency department, you want to know what we've already seen in the United States,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""You want to know what symptoms were common? Are there any markers that give a sense when a mild case is likely to progress to a severe case? What do you need to worry about?""   Health officials in three states that have already had coronavirus patients say they shared detailed clinical information about their patients with the CDC, but the CDC has not yet released it.     ""We actually submitted a paper describing the two cases to a medical journal two weeks ago,"" Dr. Allison Arwady, the commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, wrote to CNN, referring to the two cases in her city diagnosed in January. ""This paper was coauthored by CDC, state and local health department officials. It is still under review at the journal, but we expect it will be published soon.""     Dr. Sara Cody, the health officer and director of the Santa Clara County Public Health Department in California, told CNN in an email that she agreed with preparedness experts that it's important for doctors to share their experiences with treating coronavirus patients.   ""We are collaborating with the CDC on a paper to describe our cases and others, to be published in the medical literature soon,"" she wrote.     Spokespersons for two hospitals that cared for coronavirus patients -- UCSF Health in San Francisco and AMITA Health St. Alexius Medical Center Hoffman Estates in Illinois -- also wrote to CNN that they had shared information with the CDC.    A spokesperson for public health services in San Benito County, California, where there have been two cases, said that agency was collaborating with the CDC on a paper ""to be published in the medical literature soon.""     In Dane County, Wisconsin, which had one case, an official wrote that the agency had shared clinical information about a patient there with the CDC.     ""CDC is looking at all of that information in aggregate to be able to update treatment guidelines for providers,"" Sarah Mattes, a spokesperson for Public Health Madison & Dane County, wrote to CNN.     Only one US report with detailed information    Doctors and ethicists say they don't know what's taking so long.     They hold up as a gold standard the one detailed report that was has been written about a US coronavirus case. That report was published in a timely manner -- just a few days after the patient started to feel better.      That report about the United States' first coronavirus patient was published in the New England Journal of Medicine on January 31. CDC staffers were among the coauthors. The CDC references this report in its guidance to physicians.  The nine-page report provides valuable insights that could help physicians know what to expect if they care for a novel coronavirus patient -- an increasingly likely scenario as the virus spreads.    When the patient, a 35-year-old man in Washington state, was admitted to the hospital, his temperature was within a normal range and he had no shortness of breath. Six days later, he was so sick that doctors gave him supplemental oxygen and an experimental antiviral drug. Two days after that, the patient could breathe on his own and his only symptoms were an intermittent dry cough and a runny nose. The report has a chart of the patient's symptoms, results of his lab tests, and multiple X-ray images of his lungs at different points in his illness.     That's the kind of information that can help guide doctors now as new coronavirus cases pop up across the country.     ""If I'm a hospital, I want to know from the people with experience, how did they manage this patient?"" said Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at New York University. ""I don't want to know this when my first case arrives two months from now. I want to know this now so I can plan and prepare.""

Policymakers at major central banks say they are prepared to take steps as necessary to limit the damage caused by the virus as investors try to turn the page on the worst week for stocks since the global financial crisis. Stocks in Asia rebounded Monday after the Bank of Japan joined the US Federal Reserve in issuing statements designed to ease worries. But investors remained skittish in the United States and Europe as the number of infections there climbed. The virus has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 88,000 globally. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that the outbreak poses the biggest danger to the world economy since the global financial crisis. Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, said in a statement Friday that while the fundamentals of the US economy ""remain strong,"" the coronavirus ""poses evolving risks to economic activity.""  The US central bank ""will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy,"" he said. Bank of Japan boss Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank will ""closely monitor future developments, and will strive to provide ample liquidity and ensure stability in financial markets through appropriate market operations and asset purchases."" A spokesperson for the Bank of England said the bank ""continues to monitor developments and is assessing its potential impacts on the global and UK economies and financial systems.""  The central bank also said it's working with the UK government and the country's financial regulators, as well as its international partners, to ""ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability."" ECB: Not yet at point of 'persistent shock'  The European Central Bank was more guarded, saying that the outbreak is ""principally for public health authorities to report on."" ""As a central bank, our job is to assess whether and when the economic impact shifts from being an unusual temporary shock to a more persistent shock that can have a more lasting impact on demand and supply in the economy, and thereby ultimately on inflation,"" the ECB said in an emailed statement. ""We are certainly not at this point yet. This is why we are watching developments in the economy closely,"" it added. A spokesperson for the Swiss National Bank said it was considering the implications of the coronavirus on price stability. ""If the international environment were to deteriorate, this would have consequences for Switzerland as a small open economy,"" the spokesperson said. ""There could also be a direct impact via certain trading partners, such as China."" On the other hand, the central bank said that in times of uncertainty ""investors increasingly seek safe havens such as the Swiss franc, and this could lead to the franc appreciating."" How much can central banks help? Analysts are skeptical over the degree to which rate cuts will encourage consumers and businesses to spend more. ""By themselves, Fed rate cuts will not remedy"" the coronavirus, John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research said in a research note Friday.  ""What the Fed can do is help to facilitate access to financial capital for those households, businesses and local governments that incur cash flow problems owing to the virus,"" he added.  Lonski cautioned that ""volatility will rule"" in financial markets until coronavirus-related risks recede. ""Markets are trying to price in an event for which there is no readily known precedent,"" he said. — Eoin McSweeney contributed reporting. "

""We're ready. And this is an all hands on deck effort,"" Pence said confidently in an interview released Sunday with CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""  The vice president added, ""This weekend, more than 15,000 testing kits have been released. Also the FDA has approved a testing regiment that state and local officials can be using. We're addressing it, we're leaning into it."" His comments come following the first reported US death from coronavirus and amid fears over an outbreak across the nation. The Trump administration has received criticism for downplaying the significance of the virus.  Pence said Sunday that ""it is not necessary for Americans to go out and buy masks"" for coronavirus, stressing the importance of health care providers treating the virus to have access to the masks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun sending out new testing guidance to health care workers.  ""We have about, about 43 million masks stockpiled today. I want to say to your viewers though, it is not necessary for Americans to go out and buy masks,"" Pence said. ""We want to make sure -- and the President's made this clear to me, we want to make sure that people that are treating people that have contracted the coronavirus have the protective gear, the masks and the gloves and we're working very energetically to accomplish that,"" he said. US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams posted to Twitter Saturday that Americans should stop buying masks. He was responding to face mask shortages as people stocked up due to coronavirus concerns. ""They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!"" he continued. Washing your hands, staying home when sick and other ""everyday preventive actions"" are the best protections, Adams said. He urged people to get a flu shot, as fewer flu patients means more resources to fight the coronavirus. An official at US Health and Human Services said the agency has launched an investigation into a manufacturing defect in novel coronavirus tests created by the CDC. The coronavirus tests were sent to labs around the US, but weren't able to used for weeks because of a flaw. The agency is bringing together a team of non-CDC scientists ""to better understand the nature and source of the manufacturing defect in the first batch of COVID-19 test kits that were distributed to state health departments and others."" US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement: ""Upon learning about the test issue from CDC, FDA worked with CDC to determine that problems with certain test components were due to a manufacturing issue. We worked hand in hand with CDC to resolve the issues with manufacturing. FDA has confidence in the design and current manufacturing of the test that already have and are continuing to be distributed. These tests have passed extensive quality control procedures and will provide the high-level of diagnostic accuracy we need during this coronavirus outbreak."" CNN has reached out to CDC for comment. Coronavirus screening procedures President Donald Trump announced Sunday new screening procedures for coronavirus. The President tweeted that people will be screened for coronavirus upon arriving in the US if they are traveling from high-risk countries. The Trump administration announced on Saturday new travel restrictions following news of the first US fatality from the disease. The patient died in Washington and appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who spoke alongside the President at a briefing Saturday. Pence offered condolences in the CNN interview, saying that ""our hearts go out to that man's family and his friends in that community.""   Pence also told Tapper that ""it is possible"" there could be more deaths from the virus and ""more sad news,"" but ""the risk for the average American remains low."" The vice president also said Sunday that clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine could start in six weeks. ""Dr. Fauci made us aware a couple of days ago that because of the expedited process that the FDA has approved, we're actually going to be able to go to clinical trials in six weeks on a vaccine for the coronavirus,"" Pence told Fox News, adding that ""a vaccine will go through the process and likely not be available for this season.""

Children found to be exposed to coronavirus and with symptoms of respiratory disease should also be isolated, the agency told shelters.  Care providers are generally expected to have ""an identified space within the shelter facility that may be used for quarantine or isolation"" in that a child needs to be separated for a medical reason, according to the agency's website.  The guidance sent out by the US Department of Health and Human Services's Office of Refugee Resettlement is indicative of the increased vigilance across the government amid concerns over coronavirus. The dispatch lists symptoms of coronavirus, the agency's response, and specific guidance to ORR care providers. The Office of Refugee Resettlement is responsible for migrant children who come to the United States without a parent or guardian. While in government custody, the children stay at shelters across the country.  The Office of Refugee Resettlement told CNN in a statement last week that as of February 27, there have not been any suspected or confirmed COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) disease cases among unaccompanied children in ORR care. There are around 3,600 children in care.  An email went out to staff at those shelters Monday. ""This guidance is based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and is adapted for the [unaccompanied children] Program,"" the email says. ""This is a rapidly evolving situation, and updated guidance may be released in the future, as necessary."" An attached document says ORR's Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children is working with the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection, among others, to monitor when an unaccompanied child ""from a high-risk location as designated by CDC ... is initially referred to ORR care."" Unaccompanied children apprehended at the southern border are taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security and referred to Health and Human Services. The document also provides a breakdown of identification of risk and response, adding that ""any child found to be at possible risk for COVID-19 based on travel history or contact with a known case must be flagged to [Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children] via email within 4 hours.""   Care providers are expected to observe children for signs or symptoms of communicable diseases, according to ORR's website. Facilities must also alert the agency about suspected or confirmed cases of such diseases.  "

Top administration officials are also going out of their way to show they are ramping up to counter the widening threat as new cases spring up from coast to coast. Trump, for instance, says he plans to meet leaders from the pharmaceutical industry at the White House on Monday to discuss the search for a vaccine. ""Progress being made!"" the President tweeted. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the task force, plans a late afternoon televised briefing. But Democratic presidential candidates, led by former Vice President Joe Biden, are ripping into Trump for politicizing the situation. The President, his son and his conservative media cheerleaders had earlier claimed that criticism of the administration's efforts represented an orchestrated political campaign to bring him down. Trump fired back on Monday, accusing Democrats of being unfair. ""I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax,"" the President wrote. ""They didn't have a clue! Now they are fear mongering,"" the President tweeted.  On Capitol Hill, negotiators moved closer to an emergency funding package -- perhaps worth as much as $7 billion -- far above the White House's request for a $2.5 billion one -- to battle the virus, which is on the verge of becoming a global epidemic. Stirred by the virus, the political maelstrom gripping Washington intensified as the first two Americans perished from the coronavirus. Two men have now died from the disease in Washington state's King County. Both had underlying health issues, with one man in his 50s and the other was 70, officials said. There are now new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus or presumptive cases in California, Massachusetts, Washington state, Arizona, Illinois, Wisconsin, Oregon, Rhode Island, New York and Florida. ""We're seeing the beginning of community spread, which you know, is concerning,"" Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Monday on CNN's ""New Day."" ""My concern is as the next week or two or three go by, we're going to see a lot more community-related cases. That's of great concern."" As the administration confronted a fast growing crisis, Pence blanketed political talk shows Sunday in his new role as the head of the coronavirus task force. He was building on an apparent administration reset Saturday with a White House press conference involving the President and top medical officials.  Trump's earlier rambling, contentious and widely criticized first public appearance on the issue last week as well as inflammatory remarks on the virus and Democrats at a campaign rally Friday night threatened to overshadow its mitigation efforts. His previous comments that the number of US cases could soon disappear and that his administration had made ""tremendous"" efforts to thwart the virus arriving in the US now look premature. On Sunday night, the President crowed about a poll that he said showed 77% of adults were confident the government could handle the situation. ""Gallup Poll numbers on the handling of this situation are outstanding, the best. Thank you!"" The poll that he was referring to, however, appeared to be one conducted between February 3-16 -- well before the deaths on US soil, the spike of new cases and the stock market routs last week that exemplified growing panic about the coronavirus. Gallup noted at the time of the poll's release that public confidence might be based on the fact that up to that point, there had been no deaths from the virus on US soil. Pence said an emergency effort meant that 15,000 new coronavirus tests kits were sent out over the weekend. Trump announced new travel restrictions and screenings covering Iran and parts of Italy and South Korea. The vice president tried to keep the situation in perspective, but warned that there could be more deaths. ""For people that have other conditions -- that would militate toward a worse outcome, then we could have more, we could have more sad news, but the American people should know the risk to the average American remains low,"" Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union."" There are now 88 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, including 44 people evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan and three from the epicenter of the virus in Wuhan, China. There are an additional 19 travel-related cases in America, and 18 person-to-person transmissions. The origin of four other cases, in Illinois and Rhode Island is not yet established. Pence won't criticize inflammatory comments by President's son Pence defended the President's son, Donald Trump Jr., for saying that Democrats were rooting for ""millions"" of Americans to die so the coronavirus could hurt Trump politically. And he complained that the President -- who has done more to coarsen public life than any other modern politician -- had been the target of ""very strong rhetoric"" from his opponents and the media. Pence, who can be a talented communicator, gave a good impression of an administration that is coordinating across various government departments and is taking the threat of the virus seriously. His assessment of the situation was more coherent than the President's comments in the news conference on Saturday, which were often light on details and sometimes contradictory. Yet like many of the President's other political appointees, Pence's habit of repeatedly pouring praise over the President's role in the crisis so far -- possibly in the expectation that his boss was watching -- in itself politicized the response effort. In a show of focus, Trump plans to visit the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week. But the extent to which any elected leader can control the virus, the public reaction to its spread and the political and economic reverberations that saw a stock market rout last week and fears of a global economic downturn, remains uncertain. Biden, fresh off his victory in the South Carolina primary on Saturday, laid into Trump's handling of the crisis. ""The idea that Donald Trump said just several days ago this was a Democratic hoax, what in God's name is he talking about? What in God's name is he talking about? Has he no shame?"" Biden said on ""State of the Union."" Trump made the comment about a supposed ""hoax"" at a campaign rally in South Carolina on Friday night. On the defensive at his White House news conference on Saturday, he claimed, in a statement apparently contrary to the facts, that the ""hoax"" reference did not refer to the virus, but the use of it by Democrats to try to damage him politically. Another Democratic presidential candidate, Michael Bloomberg, bought prime-time exposure on CBS and NBC on Sunday night to assail Trump's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and to argue that his blend of skills after years in business and as New York's mayor would enable him to do a better job. ""At times like this it is the job of the President to reassure the public that he or she is taking all the steps necessary to protect the health and well-being of every citizen,"" Bloomberg said. Wary eyes on stocks after global rout Much of the public mood going forward could depend on how stock markets regroup after the worst week since the 2008 banking crisis triggered the Great Recession. The extent of the spread of the disease inside the US will also be important. If it can be contained to hot spots and a trickle of new cases, the political impact may be moderate. But if the disease sweeps through the population, dissatisfaction with the government response could mount. While the administration managed to largely coordinate a positive message of control over the weekend, there remain contentious questions about its handling of the crisis. For instance, there is a debate about whether the White House used the weeks between the disease's first emergence in China to properly prepare the United States for its arrival -- on issues related to hospital capacity and whether there is sufficient equipment and supplies including breathing machines for any large-scale outbreak. It remains unclear whether the public health system and hospital networks are prepared for the kind of outbreaks seen in China, South Korea and Italy for instance.

The virus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected more than 88,400 people since the outbreak began last December in Wuhan, China. The vast majority of cases and deaths are still in mainland China, concentrated in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital -- however, despite travel bans, mass quarantines and emergency measures in China, it continues to spread. The virus has reached every continent except Antarctica, with outbreak clusters in Italy and Iran rapidly spreading to nearby countries. Case numbers are rising in Canada, the United States, South Korea, and other newly-infected places. The first cases have also reached Latin America and Africa; in the latter, the virus has been reported in Egypt, Nigeria, and Algeria, raising concern of a possible spread across the continent. Italy and Iran outbreaks Iran and Italy are at the heart of the outbreaks in the Middle East and Europe. In the past 10 days, 37 countries have confirmed their first cases, mainly in these regions. Iran now has 978 cases and 54 deaths, since announcing its first case of novel coronavirus on February 19. Neighboring countries including Afghanistan, Turkey, Iraq, and others have closed borders with Iran or implemented travel restrictions.  Schools have been widely suspended in Pakistan, Iran, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and other countries. Meanwhile, Italy now has 1,694 cases and 34 deaths -- the most coronavirus cases of any country outside of Asia. And it's not slowing down -- on Sunday, Italy reported a 50% increase in cases compared to the previous day. Several cities and towns in the country's north are under lockdown, with movement limited in or out of affected areas -- effectively quarantining 100,000 people. Other countries like the US have also implemented travel restrictions to and from Italy. Two American airlines have suspended flights to Milan. Authorities in Europe are taking precautions to prevent large gatherings of people. Many public spaces like the Louvre in Paris and Milan's La Scala opera house have closed, while crowded events like the Paris half-marathon have been canceled. A French official advised against a long-time French tradition -- cheek-kissing -- to avoid close physical contact. Spreading across the Americas New cases of the virus have begun emerging in North and South America in recent days. Canada now has 24 cases, spread across Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec. The United States has 89 confirmed cases -- including 44 evacuated passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three repatriated from Wuhan, 38 cases that were detected and tested on US soil and four cases ""presumed  positive."" The US also reported its first two deaths this weekend -- one on Saturday, and one late Sunday. Both were in Washington state, where authorities are investigating a possible outbreak at a nursing facility. New York, Rhode Island, and Florida also reported their first cases this weekend. Patients in all three states had recently traveled to virus-hit countries -- one to Iran, and two to Italy. President Donald Trump warned the American public that more cases were ""likely,"" but urged them not to panic at a news conference on Saturday. He is expected to visit the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta this week. Meanwhile, new cases in Latin and South America have raised concerns; Brazil reported its first case on February 26, marking the first time the virus had reached the continent. Only days later, Mexico, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic reported their first cases. ""For several weeks, countries in the Americas have been preparing for the possible importation of cases of Covid-19,"" said Carissa F Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), in a statement on February 26 after Brazil reported its first case. ""A multi-sectoral response to ensure strengthened surveillance, health service readiness, preventing spread, and maintaining essential services, are key interventions to slow transmission and save lives."" South Korea In Asia, the spotlight is on South Korea, which has over 4,200 cases and 26 deaths. The youngest patient there is a 45-day-old baby. About 60% of all nationwide cases are linked to the Shincheonji religious group and its branch in the southern city of Daegu, which has reported more than 2,500 cases. The group, an offshoot of Christianity, faces a legal complaint filed by the Seoul city government on charges including homicide, the city announced in a news release today.  The group has been accused of withholding information or hampering officials' investigation into the virus -- but its leaders have vehemently denied these allegations. ""I'm sure there have been areas where we could have done better but we do want to emphasize that we did our best in the situation,"" Kim Shin-chang, Shincheonji director of international missions, told CNN Sunday. Kim insisted that the group had been fully transparent and cooperative, and denied the government's claim that Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan to South Korea. ""It makes me wonder if (the government ministry) are trying to exaggerate the link or possibly move the responsibility to Shincheonji,"" he said. South Korean authorities have contacted at least a third of all Shincheonji members, and warn that the number of cases may keep increasing in the coming days as they track down and test the remaining members for coronavirus.

China's factories just had a historically terrible month because of the coronavirus,2020-03-02,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/economy/china-pmi-economy-coronavirus/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk', 'https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/15/economy/china-economy-stimulus/index.html']","Hong Kong (CNN Business)China's factories are reeling from the novel coronavirus outbreak.  Manufacturing activity in the country fell to record lows last month, according to a closely watched private survey. The media group Caixin said Monday that China's manufacturing purchasing managers index sank to 40.3 in February, down from January's 51.1 and the lowest reading since the survey began in 2004. It was also well below the 45.7 that analysts polled by Reuters expected. The Caixin survey came days after the Chinese government reported that its official manufacturing PMI plunged in February to an all-time low of 35.7, down from January's reading of 50.  The official non-manufacturing PMI survey, which measures the services sector, skidded to 29.6 in February from 54.1 in January. Caixin's services survey will release later this week.  A reading above the 50-point level indicates growth compared to the previous month, while anything lower shows a contraction. A government-imposed factory shutdown weighed heavily on the manufacturing sector's performance, according to Caixin, which also said that travel restrictions hurt the labor market and left firms struggling to fill roles last month. Production, new orders and staffing levels all fell at the quickest rates on record.  The media group also said supply chains took a big hit, adding that average delivery times for goods increased at a record pace.  ""Manufacturers were faced with great pressure to deliver orders with insufficient operational capacity amid the impact of the epidemic,"" wrote Zhengsheng Zhong, chairman and chief economist at CEBM Group, in a statement that accompanied Monday's Caixin survey. February's PMI data indicates that the initial economic shock inflicted by the outbreak was even more severe than during the financial crisis, economists from Societe Generale wrote in a Monday report. They said the service sector appeared to have been hit particularly hard.  ""At the same time, they are not totally surprising for an economy that was pretty much on a total pause for half of the month and was running at less than 50% of its capacity during the other half of the month,"" the economists added. They also said the bad data may nudge Beijing closer to allowing more public infrastructure projects to go ahead after the government spent the last couple of years curtailing that activity while reining in risky lending and trying to reduce excessive debt.  The economists added that if the private sector can't revive domestic demand quickly enough, ""we could see a partial replay of 2009 stimulus."" In 2008 and 2009, Beijing injected nearly $600 billion into its economy to fight off the effects of the global slowdown. Analysts at Nomura, however, said that it's unlikely that Beijing will roll out big stimulus packages because of ""limited policy space,"" ""inflationary pressures caused by a supply shock"" and other factors. Zhong, the CEBM economist, said the Chinese economy will likely experience a ""significant rebound"" as the coronavirus is gradually contained and more people return to work. He said that proactive fiscal and monetary policies will also help with the recovery. The Societe Generale economists also expected a rebound in March, and expect China's economy to grow 4% in the first quarter. But they admitted that forecast is under pressure, and said GDP could grow by just 2.5% compared to a year earlier if manufacturing and services activity isn't strong enough. "

There are now 71 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of coronavirus in the United States. Here's what you should know to keep yourself safe:  What are the symptoms  Coronavirus makes people sick, usually with a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness, similar to a common cold. Its symptoms include a runny nose, cough, sore throat, headache and a fever that can last for a couple of days. For those with a weakened immune system, the elderly and the very young, there's a chance the virus could cause a lower, and much more serious, respiratory tract illness like a pneumonia or bronchitis.  How does it spread Transmission between humans happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough.  Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by coming into contact with something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes. Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC. The virus appears to mainly spread from person to person.  ""People are thought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic (the sickest),"" the CDC says. ""Some spread might be possible before people show symptoms; there have been reports of this occurring with ... coronavirus, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads."" How is it treated There is no specific antiviral treatment, but research is underway.  Most of the time, symptoms will go away on their own and experts advise seeking care early. If symptoms feel worse than a standard cold, see your doctor. Doctors can relieve symptoms by prescribing a pain or fever medication. The CDC says a room humidifier or a hot shower can help with a sore throat or cough.  People with coronavirus should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. In some severe cases, treatment includes care to support vital organ functions, the CDC says. People who think they may have been exposed to the virus should contact their healthcare provider immediately. How long is the incubation period Quarantine is usually set up for the incubation period -- the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For coronavirus, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure, because 14 days is the longest incubation period seen for similar illnesses.  How can you can prevent it There is no vaccine to protect against it, at least not yet.  The US National Institutes of Health is working on a vaccine but it will be months until clinical trials get underway and more than a year until it might become available.  Meanwhile, you may be able to reduce your risk of infection by avoiding people who are sick. Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze, and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Awareness is also key. If you are sick and have reason to believe it may be coronavirus, you should let a health care provider know and seek treatment early.

""These were set up a long time ago,"" the President said in the Oval Office when asked if it was a good idea to proceed with his planned rally on Monday evening in North Carolina.  Health experts have said avoiding large crowds where the virus could spread is a good idea for older people, who appear to be more vulnerable. Some major gatherings, such as industry conferences and international summits, have been scrapped, but sporting and entertainment events in the US are proceeding as planned and Democratic presidential candidates continue to host rallies. Trump insisted his campaign rallies, which can bring thousands of supporters into contained spaces, did not pose a risk. ""I think it's very safe,"" he said in the Oval Office, where he was hosting Colombia's President. Trump's event Monday evening at the Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte is currently the only rally on his upcoming schedule. He's recently been appearing in states with Democratic primary contests in the hopes of distracting from the contest to replace him. Trump said Democratic presidential candidates should be presented with the same question about hosting rallies in the age of coronavirus, though in the past he's made a point of denigrating the size of his rivals' crowds. Trump's business-as-usual approach to his campaign schedule came as his administration finds itself consumed by responding to the outbreak, which has spread to 10 states and killed two people in the United States. US officials were bracing for an uptick in diagnosed cases as more testing was being made available to state health authorities. Trump will devote much of his schedule this week to the coronavirus effort, including in-person visits to the National Institutes of Health in Maryland and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. On Monday, he's due to meet with representatives from pharmaceutical companies to discuss efforts to develop a vaccine. ""We're talking about a vaccine, maybe a cure, it's possible, we'll see about that,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Monday. ""We've asked them to accelerate whatever they're doing in terms of a vaccine."" American health officials have said a vaccine is still more than a year away from being finalized. White House officials, led by Vice President Mike Pence, also plan to meet with representatives of the airline and cruise industries this week. On Saturday, the administration announced new travel restrictions on people who'd recently visited Iran, as well as heightened advisories warning against travel to South Korea and Italy. Pence also has plans to visit the Minnesota headquarters of 3M on Thursday. The company manufactures the N95 mask, which could be used by patients and health care workers to prevent the spread of the virus. 3M said it was scaling up production of the masks, though health authorities said non-infected people don't need to wear them. But Pence, who Trump tasked with leading the administration's coronavirus response, was also not planning to forgo his political schedule. He will proceed with a planned bus tour of campaign stops in Wisconsin and Minnesota around his visit to 3M's headquarters. This story has been updated with additional reporting."

""The United States military looks at a wide variety of scenarios,"" Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said at the Pentagon, adding that ""pandemic is the worst case."" ""Of course we do all kinds of planning in the department of defense,"" Milley told reporters, adding that the military labs are working on a vaccine. ""With respect to the vaccine, yes, the military labs are working very consistently ... working in direct support with health and human services.""  Milley spoke alongside Defense Secretary Mark Esper shortly after the US canceled a joint military exercise with Israel due to the coronavirus, a US defense official told CNN Monday. The exercise, known as ""Eagle Genesis"" was to involve Army paratroops from the 173rd Airborne Brigade stationed in Vicenza, Italy.  ""In close coordination with the Israeli government and out of an abundance of caution in the face of the evolving situation with COVID-19, the decision has been made to cancel the exercise. We value our strong partnership with Israel and look forward to continuing training together in the future,"" the official said. There have been 1,600 coronavirus cases in Italy. Commanders had already restricted access to public areas such as churches, gyms and childcare centers at US army installations in Vicenza and ordered extra Meals Ready to Eat in case they have to quarantine. As of Monday, the virus had spread to 70 countries and regions, jumping from 50 on Friday. It has infected more than 89,000 around the world, killed more than 3,000 and is already having an impact on the military in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.   But Milley told reporters Monday that the overall impact of coronavirus on the US military has been ""very minimal."" ""Overseas, we have a variety of exercise operations ongoing. Right now the overall broad impact to the uniformed US military is very very minimal. That's not to say it's zero, but it's very very minimal,"" he said.  Last week the Pentagon canceled a key joint military training exercise in South Korea and is sending about 70 medical and lab personnel, doctors and nurses to support US forces there and to help test military, dependents and contractor personnel for the coronavirus once test kits arrive from the CDC. They will also to provide clinical care and laboratory support. In the Middle East, United States Central Command, which overseas operations and bases there, has cancelled all liberty and leave. Navy ships that have stopped at Pacific ports have been ordered to self-quarantine and stay at sea for two weeks to allow time to observe whether any sailors have picked up the virus. The head of US European Command, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, told the Senate Tuesday that they are carefully monitoring the infection's impact and anticipate an increase of coronavirus cases in Germany that could lead to restricted troop movement. The lockdowns in Vicenza could be extended as well, he said. In addition, the virus could affect the Pentagon's decision to proceed with a lengthy upcoming exercise, involving as many as 20,000 troops training against a Russian threat.  Steps by host countries in the Middle East are also affecting US troops. The resupply of US forces in Iraq is now being done by air because crossings at the land border between Iraq and Kuwait has been heavily restricted. And more than 60 US personnel who traveled to Israel for an exercise to train against regional threats such as Iran began returning to their bases in Europe on Friday at the request of the Israeli government, although none of them were reported to be ill.

It is responsible for an estimated 319 million jobs, or roughly one in 10 people working on the planet. And no sector is more at risk from the novel coronavirus. The travel industry has already taken a huge hit due to travel restrictions and canceled trips for both business and pleasure, but that's just the beginning. It could be the worst crisis for the industry since the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, according to some experts. ""It's on the front line of the fallout,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody's Analytics. ""It's the most directly and immediately impacted."" Travel industry crucial to the global economy The hit to the travel industry has the potential to become a major drag on the global economy if the coronavirus continues to spread around the world.  ""It's vital. If you measure the entirely of the impact of travel, it is bigger than any other industry around the world. No other industry can say it supports 1 in 10 jobs,"" said Adam Sacks, president of Tourism Economics, a leading research firm that follows the industry. His firm produced the data on the industry's global revenue and employment, the latter for the World Travel and Tourism Council. ""It's partly because it's such a diverse industry. It includes a lot of things you don't think of,"" said Sacks. ""Besides airlines and hotels, it's part of retail, part of restaurants, parts of technology."" The effect on travel is growing by the day.  There has been a sharp drop in travel across the Pacific, not just to and from China, the epicenter of the outbreak, but also to other Asian countries. This week United Airlines disclosed that it had seen a near total drop in demand to China and about a 75% decline in near-term demand on the rest of its trans-Pacific routes. Chinese nationals have become the most frequent global travelers in the world, with 180 million holding passports, compared to the 147 million Americans who have passports. And travel by the Chinese has been virtually halted due to the crisis. Sharp drop in business travel The falloff in travel has expanded beyond the Chinese market.  Several major conferences expected to draw more than 100,000 visitors each were canceled even if their location has yet to experience an outbreak. That's because people traveling from around the world could bring the virus to the event, and infected people are slow to show symptoms.  Canceled conferences include the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, the leading show for the mobile phone industry, the Geneva Motor Show, Facebook's (FB) F8 conference, and ironically enough, the ITB Berlin, the leading trade show for the travel industry itself. It was expected to draw 160,000 participants starting Wednesday. ""The fact that the largest global travel show is being canceled right now is telling,"" said Sacks. But it's not just the big shows being canceled. All kinds of business trips are being canceled or put on hold because of companies' concerns with exposing employees to unknown risks. Major companies such as Amazon (AMZN) are on record discouraging non-essential travel for employees. According to a survey of 400 businesses by the Global Business Travel Association, nearly half of businesses have already canceled or postponed at least some meetings or travel. The group estimates that up to 37% of business travel is at risk of being lost. The steep and immediate drop in willingness to travel is comparable to what happened following the 9/11 attacks, said Scott Solombrino, the trade group's executive director. Confidence started to improve as time passed after the attacks, he said. In the case of coronavirus, the concern about travel is growing each day amid new reports of outbreaks around the world. ""It is fundamentally affecting the way many companies are now doing business,"" he said. ""If this turns into a global pandemic, the industry may well lose billions of dollars -- an impact that will have negative ramifications for the entire global economy."" Leisure travel also affected It's not just business travel. Americans who were busy making plans for spring and summer trips are also thinking twice. A survey of 1,200 US adults by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in eight have already changed their travel plans due to concerns about the virus.   The overall impact depends on how long the outbreak continues. Past health crises, such as SARS epidemic, indicate people will be willing to start traveling as normal again soon after there is a sense that is safe to do so, Sacks said. ""Travel globally is incredibly resilient,"" he said. ""People's desire and need to travel outweigh their concerns fairly quickly."" But much of the travel that has been lost already, or will be canceled in weeks or months to come, is unlikely to be made up. ""This is gone, lost forever,"" said Zandi. ""It's not like you'll hold two conferences in the fall if the one this spring is canceled."" Job losses to come So far there has not been deep job cuts announced in the travel industry. But millions of workers could lose their jobs, or have their hours cut, if the demand for travel continues to be depressed. That is especially true for lower paid service jobs such as housekeeping at hotels and waiters and waitresses at restaurants.  And as those workers are forced to cut back their own spending, the impact of the slowdown will ripple through the broader economy. ""Lower income workers will be hit harder,"" said Sung Won Sohn, professor of business at Loyola Marymount Unviersity. ""They'll have to cut back their spending immediately. That has a significant multiplying effect throughout the world."" He said the drop in economic activity globally could be as much as $1 trillion. Experts don't believe that the hit to the travel industry is enough to spark a global recession by itself. But the virus is having a widespread effect on the global economy.  There has been a steep plunge in financial markets and the resulting wealth destruction, the disruption of global supply chains for manufacturers and retailers around the globe, the drop in energy prices and production due to reduced consumption All those things could combine with the hit to the travel industry to bring about a global recession. ""I don't think the worst is behind us in terms of the economic impact. The worst is yet to come,"" said Sohn.

Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Election 2020 Pete Buttigieg is out. Tom Steyer is out. Joe Biden won South Carolina. Super Tuesday is a day away. Whew! This weekend's South Carolina primary ended up forcing some Democratic presidential candidates to take a long, hard look at their chances. Former South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg suspended his campaign Sunday, and his recent primary performances suggest he failed to win over voters of color. A day earlier, billionaire Tom Steyer ended his campaign after failing to gain traction in South Carolina, where he had hoped to find a game-changing turnout. The Democratic frontrunners, however, are riding high. Biden said he had the most lucrative online fundraising day of his campaign right after his South Carolina victory. Elizabeth Warren also reported record fundraising numbers despite her disappointing fifth place finish in South Carolina, and Bernie Sanders says his February numbers shattered his previous record for the most funds raised in one month 2. Coronavirus The global death toll from the novel coronavirus has topped 3,000, and now health officials are worried about ""clusters"" of the virus spreading among neighboring countries. Iran has nearly 1,000 confirmed cases, and neighboring countries have gone as far as closing their borders to prevent the spread of the disease. Meanwhile, Italy has nearly 1,700 confirmed cases and at least 34 deaths -- the most coronavirus cases of any country outside of Asia. Several communities are under quarantine there. In the US, a second coronavirus death has heightened concern, but Congressional negotiators and the White House are reportedly close to agreeing on a multi-billion-dollar spending package to deal with the outbreak. More than 88,000 people worldwide have now been infected.

Israel Israelis are heading to the polls today for their third election in 11 months with hopes of breaking the country's deeply entrenched political deadlock. The election pits current Prime Minister and Israel's longest-serving leader Benjamin Netanyahu against his perennial challenger, former military chief Benny Gantz. Both leaders have had their shot at forming a government with their respective parties at the helm, and both have failed. There's a possibility that neither man wins today either, which means the country would have to go for a fourth vote. The stakes are especially high for Netanyahu, who is facing charges of bribery and fraud and breach of trust in three separate corruption cases. His trial is set to start two weeks after the election, but he doesn't need to give up his political seat unless he is convicted. 4. Slovakia The Eastern European country of Slovakia has successfully quelled fears of a neo-fascist surge by electing an anti-corruption party to lead its government. Politicians saw the result as a clear response to the 2018 murder of a journalist who was killed after he reported on tax evasion and fraud among Slovak businesspeople connected to the highest levels of the country's government. The killings prompted some of Slovakia's biggest anti-government protests since the communist era. Before this weekend's election, there were fears that a neo-fascist party, whose leader is on trial for hate speech, would be a decisive factor in forming the country's next government. However, the party came in fourth with less than 10% of the vote. 5. Europe immigration Tensions are high between Turkey and Greece after Turkey decided to allow refugees passage to Europe with claims the country had ""reached its capacity."" The move trampled on a 2016 deal struck with the European Union to halt migrants traveling from the Middle East towards Europe, and it also puts neighboring Greece in a difficult position. Greece has not opened its borders in response, and in fact, has beefed up security along the divide. This has created a desperate logjam of thousands of migrants, who have little access to food or shelter and could be on the precipice of a full-blown humanitarian crisis. Many of the migrants have come from Syria, where the interplay between Russia and Turkey make the situation even more complex.  BREAKFAST BROWSE Fisherman breaks state record with monster 37-pound lake trout  This is every tall fishing tale come to life.   Pita Taufatofua, the oiled-up shirtless Tongan guy, has qualified for his third Olympics  He has competed in taekwondo AND cross-country skiing, neither of which requires him to be oiled up or shirtless.

Don't politicize the coronavirus? It's way too late for that,2020-03-02,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/stephanie-grisham-fox-news-coronavirus-interview/index.html,"['https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1234533205837000705', 'https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1234533205837000705', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-press-conference/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/donald-trump-jr-coronavirus-democrats/index.html', 'https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1234462291652993032', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/us/politics/michael-bloomberg-coronavirus-ad.html?smtyp=cur&smid=tw-nytimes', 'https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/29/joe-biden-trump-coronavirus-118302']"," (CNN)On Monday, in an interview with Fox News, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham accused Democrats and the media of trying to politicize the coronavirus. ""This is not the time to politicize something,"" Grisham scolded critics of how President Donald Trump has handled the issue to date, adding: ""It's really disappointing and it shows a complete lack of leadership."" She then tweeted the same idea, saying, ""Coronavirus should not be a partisan political issue. It is time for the Dems to support the decisive actions taken by President @realDonaldTrump to ensure the risk to Americans remains low."" Which, well, OK. Grisham is engaging in a bit of selective memory here. It's been less than a week since Trump held a press conference focused on his administration's reaction to the coronavirus threat, in which he repeatedly praised himself and criticized his, uh, critics.  ""We have, through some very good early decisions, decisions that were ridiculed at the beginning, we closed up our borders to flights coming in from certain areas, areas that were hit by the coronavirus and hit pretty hard,"" Trump said. ""We've had tremendous success -- tremendous success beyond what people would have thought."" It's also been less than a week since Donald Trump Jr., the eldest son of the President, went on Fox News and said this about Democrats and coronavirus:  ""Anything that they can use to try to hurt Trump, they will. ... But for them to try to take a pandemic and seemingly hope that it comes here, and kills millions of people so that they could end Donald Trump's streak of winning, is a new level of sickness. You know, I don't know if this is coronavirus or Trump derangement syndrome, but these people are infected badly."" And it's been mere hours since the President tweeted this: ""I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn't have a clue! Now they are fear mongering."" So on one level, Grisham's appeal for an apolitical response is deeply hypocritical. It's also incredibly unrealistic. Here's why: Coronavirus is the story, not just in America but across the world. As often happens in moments of crisis like this one, people are worried. They look to their government and particularly the President for reassurance and guidance.  Which means -- breaking news! -- that there are politics in every single situation like this. From blizzards to hurricanes to oil spills to, yes, coronavirus, there are always politics. That doesn't mean that the political calculations are the key consideration in tragedies. It just means that any event that impacts the country -- or at least captivates the country for a day or a month -- have political reverberations.  And in fact, there are times when appeals to being apolitical actually miss the point entirely. Take the ongoing crisis of school shootings. For years, there was a push to never even talk about politics following the use of a gun to commit an act of mass violence. The only focus should be on thoughts and prayers for the victims, said those apolitical forces. But to only do that is to ignore that, of course, the decisions being made around guns by elected officials have a profound impact on these events. Mass shootings are inherently politically events in that they reflect our broader political culture, in which preserving the rights of gun owners has been the primary focus of elected officials for decades. Ditto the current reaction to the coronavirus outbreak. The reality is that decisions made by our public officials -- whether in funding for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention or in how much or little information about the virus to make public or in the rapidity of providing tests for the virus available -- already have, and will continue to, effect both the spread of the virus and our perceptions about how vulnerable we are to it. That's why former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg spent millions of dollars on a three-minute TV ad on Sunday night in which he sought to portray himself as the sort of candidate who has the experience and judgment to deal with a challenge like coronavirus -- citing his experience handling the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks as mayor. Former Vice President Joe Biden used Trump's press conference to score political points too, saying on the campaign trail, ""The President of the United States says it's a hoax? It's hard to believe. Even for him it's hard to believe."" Which wasn't fair either, considering that Trump didn't call coronavirus a hoax, he said that Democrats were using the fears surrounding it to harm him politically. And Sen. Chuck Schumer went after Trump on the outbreak on the Senate floor Monday, saying that the President has downplayed coronavirus to a ""dangerous degree,"" adding that Trump ""only cares about himself and his image. And he tries, as usual, instead of solving the problem -- to blame everyone else."" But the personal, meaning that which does or might affect our personal lives and those of our families, is always political. In that regard, the coronavirus outbreak -- and its effects -- were bound to become political, too. "
Second coronavirus death reported in the United States and first case confirmed in New York,2020-03-02,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/coronavirus-outbreak-intl-hnk', 'https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-28-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/washington-state-possible-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/us-coronavirus-saturday/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/health/coronavirus-uncounted-cases-community-spread/index.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/world/coronavirus-news.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-01-20-intl-hnk/index.html']"," (CNN)The first novel coronavirus cases were reported in Florida and New York on Sunday while officials in Washington state confirmed the second US death from the outbreak. The New York patient is a woman in her late 30s, who contracted the virus while traveling in Iran and is currently isolated in her home, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. ""The patient has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to New York,"" Cuomo's statement read. The New York State Department of Health said the patient went to a hospital in Manhattan after contracting the virus.  Cuomo said approval for state testing was granted Saturday and the positive test was confirmed by New York's Wadsworth Lab in Albany.   ""There is no cause for surprise -- this was expected,"" Cuomo said. ""As I said from the beginning, it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York."" Disease detectives in New York have already identified close contacts of the patient, according to New York City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot.  ""As we confront this emerging outbreak, we need to separate facts from fear, and guard against stigma and panic,"" Barbot said.  Coronavirus cases continue to rise in US  Officials in King County, Washington, confirmed the second US coronavirus death was a male patient in his 70s with underlying health conditions. He was hospitalized at Evergreen Health in Kirkland and died Saturday, according to a King County Public Health news release. Vice President Mike Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that more US deaths were ""possible."" ""We could have more sad news,"" he said. ""But the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low."" The New York case was one of several reported Sunday. Two new presumptive positive cases were identified in Florida, according to a press release from the Florida Department of Health. These are the first cases in the state of Florida. Seven more cases were reported in Washington state, bringing the total to 13 cases. Three have been reported in Snohomish County and 10 have been reported in King County, including two deaths. But those were just the latest developments in Washington state, where officials Saturday announced the first coronavirus death in the US and where authorities were investigating a nursing facility outside Seattle.  Of the 88,443 cases confirmed globally, at least 3,041 have been fatal -- 2,912 of which were in China. The US has at least 89 confirmed cases of the virus, according to counts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state and local health authorities.  Officials investigate Washington nursing facility Among the US cases are several believed to have been spread person-to-person with unknown origins, including the patient in Washington state who died, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC.  The patient was a man in his 50s with underlying health conditions, according to Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County, Washington. Officials announced two cases linked to Life Care Center, a nursing facility in Kirkland, Washington, including a 40-year-old health care worker and a woman in her 70s. The health care worker is in satisfactory condition at a local hospital, and the woman in her 70s is hospitalized in serious condition. But more than 50 residents and staff at the facility are experiencing symptoms and will be tested for coronavirus, Duchin told reporters Saturday. Four new presumptive positive cases were detected Sunday, all of whom were residents of the Life Care Center, according to a press release from Seattle and King County Public Health. . ""We're in the process of investigating this situation as an outbreak,"" he said.  ""We take the event very seriously,"" a statement from the facility's executive director said, in part. Life Care Center is not allowing visits from families, volunteers or vendors, and admissions have been placed on hold for the time being, the statement said. But residents and staff weren't the only ones impacted.  At least 25 firefighters and two police officers who responded to the Life Care Center have now been placed under quarantine ""out of an abundance of caution,"" according to a statement from the City of Kirkland. Firefighters are either under quarantine at home or at a Kirkland fire station, the statement said. There were also concerns that 16 nursing students and a faculty member from Lake Washington Institute of Technology were exposed to the virus after visiting the center late last week, the school said in a statement. The campus will be closed Monday and Tuesday to be cleaned and disinfected. Five more cases identified in California A total of five new presumptive positive cases of coronavirus were identified in California Sunday, according to health departments in three counties. Two patients are health care workers from Alameda County and Solano County, according to a joint press release from two localities. Both are employees at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville, California, according to the release. Vacaville is about 34 miles southwest of Sacramento. The two patients came into contact with a community-acquired case currently hospitalized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, the release said. The patients are currently in isolation at home. These cases are pending confirmatory testing from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the release said. The three other cases were identified in Santa Clara County, according to the county's health department. The total number of cases in the county is now seven, the release said. One of the cases in Santa Clara is a woman with chronic health issues who is hospitalized, the release said. Officials have not said how this person contracted the virus. The other two cases are a husband and wife, the release said. Both are hospitalized and the husband has chronic health conditions. Both recently traveled to Egypt, the release said. The Rhode Island Department of Health announced the state's first presumptive positive case on Sunday morning. The patient was said to be in their 40s and had in mid-February traveled in Europe, including Italy, where there were 1,694 cases as of Sunday.  The Rhode Island patient is being treated at an undisclosed hospital, and officials are reaching out to people who have had direct contact with the individual, the state Department of Health said in a statement. The patient has had limited travel within the state and hasn't been to work since returning from Italy. Rhode Island reported a second case later on Sunday, a teenage girl with mild symptoms.  A second case was also reported in Oregon on Sunday. The Washington County adult had close household contact with the state's initial case and did not require medical attention, the Oregon Health Authority said in a news release.  Among the US cases are 44 people who were aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, three people who were repatriated from China and 42 cases that were detected in the US. At least 19 cases in the US are travel-related and at least 19 are linked to person-to-person spread, according to the CDC. Four are of unknown origin.  But New York University doctors and other experts say the US probably has more cases than identified officially. That's because of testing delays and the virus' ability to spread before an infected person shows any symptoms.  The New York Times reported Sunday the virus might have been in Washington state for weeks and up to 1,500 people might be infected there.  US expands travel restrictions The vice president said Saturday the administration is expanding existing travel restrictions on Iran to include foreign nationals who had visited Iran in the last 14 days.  The US will also increase travel advisories for Italy and South Korea to Level 4 -- the highest level -- advising Americans not to travel to specific regions in those countries. On Sunday, President Trump announced via Twitter new screening procedures for people arriving in the US if they are traveling from ""high-risk countries."" Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Pence, clarified to CNN what is covered under the screening measures Trump mentioned in his tweet: ""There is already screening for those coming into the United States for those who have been in China in the last 14 days. This will be expanded to Italy and South Korea. Additionally, we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy, and other European nations as needed,"" Miller said. CNN's Melissa Alonso, Natasha Chen, Madeline Holcombe, Artemis Moshtaghian, Michael Nedelman and Alta Spells contributed to this report."

Even worse: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects the virus to keep spreading beyond this year. Here's what you need to know about the illness and how to stay safe:  What are the symptoms?  Fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat and trouble breathing are some of the most common symptoms of the novel coronavirus.  ""It can be more severe for some persons and can lead to pneumonia or breathing difficulties,"" the World Health Organization says.  ""More rarely, the disease can be fatal. Older people, and people with preexisting medical conditions (such as diabetes and heart disease) appear to be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill with the virus."" What can businesses do?  It's important that companies encourage sick employees to stay home, the CDC says.  ""Do not require a healthcare provider's note for employees who are sick with acute respiratory illness ... as healthcare provider offices and medical facilities may be extremely busy and not able to provide such documentation in a timely way,"" the CDC said.  Sick employees shouldn't return to work until their temperature has stayed below 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) for at least 24 hours, without the help of fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicine, the CDC said. And now is the time to make sure workplaces are squeaky clean.  ""Routinely clean all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops and doorknobs,"" the CDC said.  ""Provide disposable wipes so that commonly used surfaces (for example, doorknobs, keyboards, remote controls, desks) can be wiped down by employees before each use."" And while it may seem basic, many adults don't practice correct coughing and sneezing etiquette (cover your mouth and nose entirely with a tissue or your upper sleeve) or wash their hands properly for at least 20 seconds.  So the CDC advises companies to hang posters about how to prevent the spread of illness.  How can you protect yourself?  In general, the public should do ""what you do every cold and flu season,"" said Dr. John Wiesman, the health secretary in Washington state. That includes washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Don't forget to wash the backs of your hands and under your nails, the CDC says. The World Health Organization recommends staying at least 3 feet (or 1 meter) away from anyone who may be infected.  If you're the one feeling sick, cover your entire mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. But don't use your hands. Use either your bent elbow or a tissue that you throw away immediately afterward. While the CDC does not recommend N95 respirator masks for the general public, it does recommend them for health care workers.  But certain types of facial hair can prevent respirators from working effectively. The CDC has an infographic showing which styles of facial hair are riskier than others.  Why is this coronavirus different?  There are many kinds of coronaviruses, including some that cause the common cold.  But this deadly strain is called a ""novel"" coronavirus because it has not previously been identified in humans.  It's unusual for several reasons:  -- Scientists believe this type of coronavirus jumped from a different animal to humans, which is rare.  -- It then became transmissible from human to human, which is even more rare. -- An infected person might not show symptoms for up to 14 days after exposure. That's especially worrisome because this novel coronavirus can be transmitted while a person still isn't showing any symptoms. Is there a cure for novel coronavirus?  No. While many patients have recovered from their symptoms, there is no known cure. But the first US study of a drug to treat novel coronavirus in humans is underway at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha.  That clinical trial will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the antiviral drug remdesivir in adults diagnosed with coronavirus, the US National Institutes of Health said.  What about a vaccine?  Scientists are working on a vaccine, but don't expect it anytime soon.  The NIH is trying to develop one but says it will take at least a few months before clinical trials start and more than a year until a vaccine could become available. Separately, scientists in Texas, New York and China also are trying to create a vaccine, said Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. But the challenge is daunting, Hotez said. ""The lesson we've learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats.""

"Surgeon general: Be cautious, but not afraid of coronavirus",2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/opinions/coronavirus-prepare-not-panic-opinion-adams/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/opinions', 'https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/hygiene/etiquette/coughing_sneezing.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/face-masks-coronavirus-surgeon-general-trnd/index.html', 'https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu']","Vice Adm. Jerome M. Adams, M.D., is the 20th surgeon general of the United States. He is a board-certified anesthesiologist with a master's degree in public health and a member of the President's Coronavirus Task Force. Before being selected for his current position, he served as the Indiana health commissioner from 2014 to 2017. The opinion expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinions on CNN.  (CNN)Since being named to the coronavirus task force, I've quickly made a few observations. It is clear we must continue to help Americans understand how to protect themselves, but also that we mustn't recreate the wheel. To address the disease outbreak, we can rely on tried-and-true planning and preparation that was begun long ago.   While the novel coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, can be scary, Americans should remember we've experienced other disease outbreaks that we not only managed but overcame. With each occurrence we learned and strengthened our preparedness for the next. Our history with these outbreaks gives us confidence that we have the knowledge, tools and talent to address COVID-19.  We have the very best medical experts and scientists working with Vice President Mike Pence and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, all taking the necessary steps to protect the public. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Bob Redfield, is an internationally recognized clinical virologist. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is a world-renowned and respected immunologist who has helped our country navigate viral outbreaks in the past. While we must not become complacent, the public can be assured that we have the best scientific team in the world working day and night to keep our country safe.  Part of my job as surgeon general is to communicate the best available science to the American people — and that includes how we as a country, as communities and individuals, should act to stay healthy. This is especially important as we see more potential community spread and the US response broadens to include both a focus on containment of the virus and limiting its impact. Communities and institutions should review their pandemic response plans put together or refined during previous outbreaks like the H1N1 flu virus, SARS and Ebola. Health care providers should be on the lookout for patients who have traveled to coronavirus-affected regions and patients with fever and respiratory illness but no alternative explanation, like influenza. There are things that average Americans should — and shouldn't — do to protect themselves. Because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, there are basic public health measures that can limit its spread. Washing hands frequently, staying away from sick people or staying home if sick yourself and covering your cough or sneeze are scientifically proven as some of the best and most practical ways for individuals to stay disease-free.   Masks are not recommended for use by most Americans and hoarding of masks can actually hurt our response by reducing the supply available for medical professionals who need them. It's critically important our health providers have masks and other medical supplies when caring for people who have been exposed to the virus.  Finally, there have been many comparisons of coronavirus to flu. Such head-to-head comparisons aren't always helpful, but it is worth noting that we are in the midst of a severe flu season and the flu is still a significant risk to many Americans. Getting your flu shot not only decreases the likelihood you will get or be hospitalized from the flu but preventing the flu can support our response to COVID-19. Community capacity to respond to COVID-19 will be all the stronger if we prevent excess seasonal flu cases through higher flu vaccination. This is particularly true if those flu cases are severe and require hospitalization, thus utilizing key hospital resources.  Americans should take comfort in knowing that we have the best team in the world to protect them from COVID-19, and the best public health and health care systems to rely on. We should be cautious and take appropriate measures to prepare and protect ourselves, but we should not be afraid. We've been through this before and no place in the world is better prepared to handle this challenge. Let's turn fear into actions that will help us all stay safe.  "
Her husband is a patient at a Washington nursing facility being investigated for a possible coronavirus outbreak and she wants answers,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/washington-state-nursing-facility-coronavirus-investigation/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/washington-state-possible-coronavirus-outbreak/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/health/us-coronavirus-sunday/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/health/face-masks-coronavirus-surgeon-general-trnd/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html']"," (CNN)Bonnie Holstad stood outside a long-term nursing facility in Washington state Sunday holding a sign in hopes of getting information on her husband's condition. Holstad's husband, Ken, has been staying at the Life Care Center -- where more than 50 residents and staff are experiencing coronavirus symptoms -- after a fall that broke his hip.  He has Parkinson's disease and dementia and also has a cough, she said.  ""No one at Life Care is answering the phones,"" the sign read. ""He needs to be attended to ... what is his temperature?"" At least two coronavirus cases have been confirmed at the center in Kirkland, Washington: a 40-year-old health care worker and a woman in her 70s who is hospitalized in serious condition. Four new presumptive positive cases were announced Sunday. More than 50 residents and staff will be tested after showing symptoms, said Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County. In a statement, the facility said it's not allowing visits from families, volunteers or vendors, and is also placing admissions on hold for the time being. ""I'm very worried for my husband,"" Holstad said. ""He's one of the vulnerable people,"" because of his age and his Parkinson's disease. A nurse did go down to check on him, she told CNN, and Holstad was told he doesn't have a fever. He's not being tested for the virus, she said, because he doesn't have all symptoms required for testing. ""I was so angry. How can this be that I have to do this, make a sign and go down there?"" Holstad said. CNN emailed the Life Care Center on Sunday about Holstad's husband but did not receive a response. ""I have real problems with how they're handling the interface with family,"" she said, remarking it was ""sort of like a movie about an epidemic in a little town, and they don't know how to handle the situation."" It's not just the question of his care, Holstad said, but also the fact that family members aren't given any information on what they should be doing after being in contact with the center's residents. Nine family members had visited her husband this week, she said. Holstad noticed staff members wearing masks when she was there Wednesday, she said, but she was told it was because some residents had colds.  On Saturday, when she arrived with sandwiches to have lunch with her husband, there was a sign on the door that visitors weren't allowed. It wasn't until she got home and listened to a voicemail from the center that she knew about the coronavirus there. Washington cases rise to 13 In all, 13 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Washington state.  The state has the second highest number of cases in the nation after California, which has 16. The only two confirmed deaths of coronavirus patients in the United States have occurred in Washington. The second death was a resident of the Life Care Center. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency Saturday, directing state agencies to use all resources necessary to respond to the outbreak. ""This number is expected to rise as more people are tested and results confirmed,"" a news release from the health department said.

Four of the people who died were residents at the Life Care Center nursing care facility in Kirkland, in suburban Seattle, King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin said Monday. Four other coronavirus cases are also linked to the Life Care Center. ""Current residents and associates continue to be monitored closely, specifically for an elevated temperature, cough and/or shortness of breath,"" officials said in a statement on the Life Care website. ""Any resident displaying these symptoms is placed in isolation. Associates are screened prior to beginning work and upon leaving."" So far, every death from novel coronavirus in the United States has been in Washington state.  A recent surge of cases nationwide has prompted new travel restrictions, school closures and emergency declarations.  But now is not the time to panic, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said.  ""I want folks to understand that we knew this was coming, we told folks that this was going to happen and it is why we've been preaching preparedness from the very start,"" Adams said Monday.  ""Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not."" Two dozen new cases were reported over the weekend, including the first two deaths from the virus in the United States. There are 102 cases reported nationwide, according to the federal and state health officials, including: 45 former passengers of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, the site of a recent outbreak and quarantine3 Americans recently repatriated from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak17 people believed to have contracted the virus through travel 37 people who got sick from another person in the United States, including some who don't know who the source was At least 4 deaths linked to one facility A cluster of cases has been reported at the Life Care Center. Four residents of the facility have died from the virus. At least two of them -- a man and woman in their 70s -- had underlying health conditions, health officials said. ""As you know, we tragically have experienced several more deaths reported today. And our condolences go out to their families, of course,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said at a White House meeting with pharmaceutical companies to discuss developing a coronavirus vaccine. More than 50 residents and staff have been experiencing symptoms and will be tested for coronavirus, Duchin said.  The facility has about 108 residents and 180 staff members, he said. An investigation into the facility was launched after a resident and a health care worker tested positive for the coronavirus, Duchin said.  Gov. Jay Inslee told reporters: ""Our priority now is to slow the spread of this dangerous virus."" Inslee, a Democrat who is running for reelection, said he is not shaking hands right now as a precaution and also stayed home from work last Wednesday because he had a cough. 'We will have more cases. ... That is inevitable' At least 12 states have cases of coronavirus: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Oregon, Rhode Island, New York, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin. The patient in Arizona has recovered, state Department of Health Services Director Dr. Cara Christ said. New York's first case is a 39-year-old health care worker who recently returned from Iran, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Monday. Iran is dealing with almost 1,000 cases of coronavirus and at least 54 deaths from the illness.  The woman is in home isolation with her husband, who is also a health care worker and is being tested for the disease.  The woman did not have any symptoms of illness when she flew back to the United States last Tuesday, officials said. But authorities are contacting people on her flight and the driver of the private car service she used to get to her Manhattan home.  The woman has not used public transportation since she came back to the New York, Cuomo said.  He said the goal now is to ""test as many as you can"" and then isolate anyone who tests positive to help reduce the spread. ""We will have more cases. We will have community spread. That is inevitable,"" Cuomo said.   But he said there's no need to panic.  ""You can't let the fear outpace reality,"" he said.  ""Put this in perspective. This is not the first time we've dealt with this situation,"" he said. ""We had H1N1, we had the swine flu, we had the avian flu, we went through Ebola, we went through MERS, we went through SARS. We've dealt with this before."" The governor also announced the state will institute a new cleaning protocol at schools and in the public transportation system to help stop any potential spread of the virus.    Florida and Washington state issue emergency declarations At least 18 new cases were announced across the country Sunday, including the first two cases reported in Florida. The Florida cases include a Hillsborough County resident who has a history of travel to Italy, one of countries hard-hit by coronavirus. The other is a Manatee County resident who had no history of travel outside the United States, state health officials said.  Both Florida residents are in self-isolation and will remain there until they are cleared by health officials, the Florida Department of Health said. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a public health emergency as a result of the cases. The New York Times reported Sunday the virus might have been in Washington state for weeks, and as many as 1,500 people might be infected there. More cases from coast to coast Georgia has confirmed its first two cases of coronavirus, Gov. Brian Kemp announced during a news conference Monday night. The cases involve two individuals who reside in the same household, one of whom recently returned to the US from Italy. Both are isolated at home to keep the illness from spreading, Kemp said. In Northern California, five new cases were reported Sunday -- three of them in Santa Clara County.  One patient was a woman who had underlying health issues and was hospitalized. Two others were a husband and wife who had recently traveled to Egypt, according to a news release from the Santa Clara Public Health Department.  The new cases brought the total number of cases in Santa Clara County to seven.  Alameda County and Solano County each had one resident test positive for the virus, a joint news release from the counties' health departments said. Both are health care workers who were exposed to a patient at UC Davis in Sacramento, the release said.  More than 120 UC Davis health care staff were in self-quarantine after possibly being exposed to the patient admitted to the medical center last week. Oregon reported its second case Sunday. The Washington County adult had close household contact with the state's initial case and did not require medical attention, the Oregon Health Authority said. New cases were also announced in Rhode Island, the first two in the state. A woman and a teenage girl were diagnosed with the virus, Rhode Island health officials said. They had traveled to Europe on the same trip in mid-February, the state's Department of Health said. Three people in Oregon are presumed to have the disease.  Presumptive positive cases mean test results by a public health lab turned out positive but are still pending confirmation from the CDC.  Schools in the Seattle area, Portland area and Rhode Island announced closures for cleaning this week after presumptive positive cases linked to students or staff.

The Fed just hit the coronavirus panic button,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/investing/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-coronavirus-emergency/index.html,['http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/economy/federal-reserve-rate-cut/index.html'],"New York (CNN Business)The stock market -- and President Trump -- really wanted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates as soon as possible because of concerns about coronavirus. Everybody got their wish. The Fed blinked Tuesday morning, slashing interest rates by a half of a percentage point in an emergency rate cut.  The timing of the cut is a bit surprising considering that Fed chair Jerome Powell and US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said just a few hours earlier the US and other G7 nations were prepared to take action but stopped short of saying something was imminent. And the Fed has a regularly scheduled policy meeting in just a little more than two weeks. But experts said Tuesday that the Fed had to act now. It was the only way to reassure investors the central bank was taking the threat seriously. ""The Fed could not ignore that there would be a real economic impact from the coronavirus,"" said Tony Fratto, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and former Treasury Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs in George W. Bush's administration. ""For the Fed to do that and wait until the next policy meeting would not be credible. Things are moving too quickly,"" he added. Fratto said the onus is now on health authorities, Congress and the White House to ""step up"" and follow the Fed's lead. More urgent action is needed to ensure the coronavirus does not spread and that proper funding is in place to handle the crisis, he added. Rates could keep heading lower The Fed might not be done yet, however.   The markets remain worried that coronavirus' economic damage could last not just weeks, but several months or even quarters. The unclear timeline might be why the Fed is erring on the side of caution. ""A lot of people are not sure if this is temporary or something much worse. But when you see companies like Apple and Microsoft warn because of demand and supply issues, it gives people more reasons to be worried about the impact,"" said Scott Kessler, global sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, in an interview with CNN Business. Another market expert said it's critical for Powell and other Fed members to stress they're willing to do ""whatever it takes"" to keep the economy from spiraling out of control, borrowing a phrase from former European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. The Fed has a meeting planned on March 18, and it could cut rates again then. ""This is a more preemptive Fed. The odds of another rate cut in two weeks are high,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist with AllianceBernstein.  ""It's critical for the Fed to cut again. The market doesn't want one-off responses. The Fed has to be willing to cut repeatedly. If this is a one-and-done cut, that's a disaster and counterintuitive,"" Winograd added, saying he thinks the Fed might lower rates by another half-point at the regularly scheduled meeting later this month.

Mohammad Mirmohammadi, 71, was a member of the Expediency Council that advises Khamenei. He is the latest Iranian official to contract the virus.  One of the country's top clerics, Hadi Khosroshahi, died last Thursday after he contracted the sickness.  Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar and Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi, who was heading the government's task force on coronavirus, have also fallen ill, according to state media. The virus started spreading through Iran last week, and by Monday at least 66 people were dead and 1,501 cases were confirmed, deputy health minister Alireza Raisi said on state TV. Raisi added that 291 people had recovered. People who have recently traveled to Iran have tested positive. Those travelers were from  Afghanistan, Canada, Lebanon, Pakistan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Iran has the most coronavirus cases in the Middle East, the most deaths outside of China -- where the virus originated -- and is in an ongoing state of economic crisis. US sanctions on the country have seen its currency tank and unemployment grow.  Iran's parliament has been suspended until further notice amid the outbreak, and universities and schools nationwide have been closed, according to state media. All public gatherings, including Friday prayers, have been canceled to help curb the spread of the disease, the IRNA state news agency reported. A staff member of the World Health Organization team in Iran has tested positive for the virus, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news conference Monday. The staff member has a ""mild disease,"" Ghebreyesus said.

It also brought enough laboratory kits to test and diagnose nearly 100,000 people. CNN's Mitchell McCluskey in Atlanta and Sara El Sirgany in Abu Dhabi contributed reporting. "
"Uber, Lyft warn drivers about coronavirus, but offer no paid sick days",2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/tech/gig-economy-coronavirus/index.html,"['http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/29/tech/uber-lyft-doordash-ab5-ballot-measure/index.html', 'https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-02-25/instacart-ab5-shoppers-independent-contractors-san-diego', 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=UBER&source=story_quote_link', 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=LYFT&source=story_quote_link', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/success/unpaid-sick-leave-coronavirus/index.html', 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/share-facts.html', 'https://www.lyft.com/safety/coronavirus']","New York (CNN Business)Sanitizers at driver service locations. Reminders not to discriminate against passengers of any kind. But no paid sick days.  This is the gig economy in the time of coronavirus.  As cases of coronavirus start to rack up in the US, the people who give rides, deliver groceries or restaurant orders for gig economy companies could be on the frontlines of the outbreak as people avoid public transportation and rely on home deliveries instead of frequenting restaurants and stores.  Now, on-demand companies are beginning to issue some precautionary guidance. But because the companies largely treat their workers as independent contractors -- a status that is currently being challenged in the state of California -- they aren't currently entitled to benefits such as health insurance, paid time off or sick leave. Uber (UBER) and Lyft (LYFT) sent messages to workers in recent days with guidance. Both offered the predictable reminder that handwashing and cleanliness are important and noted drivers should disinfect their vehicles frequently. Lyft said it is also distributing sanitizer to drivers at places including its driver service locations and airport queues.  Both Uber and Lyft said they have established teams devoted to responding to the issue. Uber told drivers that it is ""working closely with public health authorities to pass along the most up-to-date guidance,"" which included ""if you feel sick, stay home,"" according to the message within the Uber driver app, seen by CNN Business. But the fact remains that these workers do not have paid sick days, meaning they potentially must weigh their livelihood against risking their health and that of their passengers. ""True to their business model, so-called gig companies continue to put risk on the backs of those who produce value for the company,"" said Veena Dubal, a labor law expert and associate professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. ""In this instance, the allocation of risk threatens not only the lives and health of the gig workers, but also the consumers who use the services. "" In Mexico, two Uber drivers unknowingly transported a passenger who was infected and then went on to provide more rides. In response, the company temporarily suspended 240 passengers who may have been exposed as a result. The anecdote highlights how many lives a gig worker interacts with by doing their jobs. All drivers and riders have since been reactivated, the company said. Food delivery services Postmates and DoorDash, and grocery delivery company Instacart, also recently issued guidance to their delivery workers. In a statement to CNN Business, Instacart nodded to the fact that customers have been using the platform to brace for coronavirus. ""Over the last few days, we've seen a surge in customer demand for pantry items such as powdered milk and canned goods, as well as personal care products like hand sanitizer and vitamins."" Driver forums have been active with conversations about what precautions some are taking, if any. In groups on Facebook, for example, some drivers have suggested not taking passengers coming from airports or hospitals. There are also several comments from drivers about not accepting passengers who appear to be from China, where coronavirus -- also known as Covid-19 -- was first detected, with other drivers pushing back on this idea, calling it racist. Others suggest not driving at all. (As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes, ""people of Asian descent, including Chinese Americans, are not more likely to get COVID-19 than any other American."") In a notice about coronavirus, Lyft reminds drivers that it does ""not tolerate discrimination of any kind."" In an email to its drivers, Uber said they can ""choose not to accept or cancel a trip"" if they feel ""uncomfortable picking up a passenger for safety reasons,"" but said it is ""absolutely against Uber's Community Guidelines to discriminate against anyone based on their race or national origin.""

Wolf told the House Homeland Security Committee that the decision was made ""out of an abundance of caution."" He said employees have been told to ""telework,"" if possible, to reduce the chance that it will spread, and that the facility will remain closed for 14 days. Employees were also ""directed to self-quarantine for 14 days."" A spokesperson for the department confirmed to CNN that the facility is a Citizenship and Immigration Services field office located in Seattle. Wolf, who said he learned of the situation late Monday night, said the employee visited a family member at the Life Care Facility in Kirkland, Washington, before it was known that the facility was impacted by the coronavirus outbreak. The nursing care and rehabilitation facility is now at the center of the outbreak in the US, with four deaths tied to the site and relatives and friends of its 108 patients barred from visiting.  Six people have now died in Washington state from the novel coronavirus, according to health officials.   ""I am pleased to report that this employee embodied what it means to lead by example,"" Wolf said. ""The employee and their family took every precaution and followed the guidance of public health officials. They stayed home from work when they felt ill, the family self-quarantined, and reported the exposure and their condition to their employers and other officials."" Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli wrote in a series of tweets Tuesday morning that the employee was exhibiting ""flu-like symptoms four days after visiting the nursing home"" and that the individual showed up to work in the days between their possible exposure and when they became ill.  The department ""takes the safety & health of our employees & applicants seriously,"" Cuccinelli wrote. ""We're following CDC's guidelines & encourage all employees and applicants to stay home if they are feeling ill or exhibiting any flu-like symptoms.""  Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, had kicked off Tuesday's hearing by expressing concern about the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus, saying Wolf was there ""under extraordinarily troubling circumstances.""  ""Americans are rightfully concerned about the coronavirus that has spread across the globe and claimed the lives of thousands, including at least six here at home,"" said Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat. ""They are looking to their government for leadership and guidance. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has not been equal to the task so far.""

""I can't get sick. I can't get sick,"" the President insists when he wants to justify dismissing from the room an underling who might infect him with a bug, according to people who have heard him say it. Experienced aides have encouraged others not to take it personally.  In some ways, Trump has been unwittingly preparing his staff for years to prevent the spread of coronavirus. He is a self-described germaphobe who is known to glare at aides who sneeze in his vicinity or try to shake hands with him after coughing. Before becoming president, he once wrote the practice of shaking hands was ""barbaric,"" though it's one political tradition even he's been unable to banish. In the age of coronavirus, the White House is the hub for the federal response -- its secure Situation Room used to convene meetings of the President's task force and the once-underused Briefing Room suddenly sprung into service for daily updates from officials. But the complex is also a workplace where more than a thousand employees, some stuffed into tight workspaces, work for a boss infamous for a fear of germs and a disgust of illness. At least once a week, the operation travels en masse with the President on political or official trips aboard a fleet of aircraft led by Air Force One. Teleworking, while encouraged at some federal agencies, is rare. And like other workplaces across the country, White House officials are beginning to brace for the possibility -- some say the eventuality -- that coronavirus strikes. The President has sought to impart some of his anti-germ tendencies. ""When somebody sneezes -- I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they're sneezing,"" Trump said last week during a briefing on the coronavirus, using his own aversion to potential maladies as an example for Americans trying to avoid getting sick. Since then, Trump has seemed to adopt a more sober tone when discussing the coronavirus outbreak, which has now spread to 118 people in the United States, including nine deaths. In recent days, advisers close to the President urged him to stop downplaying the outbreak, warning it could hurt him in the long run if the number of cases continues to skyrocket. Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, had been one official who had encouraged the President to tamp down alarm in hopes of stabilizing the markets. West Wing precautions Inside the West Wing, the political ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak have become more apparent as the stock market convulses and the number of American deaths rise. But even as they confront the national crisis, staffers are taking their own precautions to avoid getting sick. Staffers recently received advisories about the coronavirus epidemic that focused on prevention and guidelines for what to do if experiencing coronavirus symptoms. The information distributed to staff included a one-pager from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminding people to wash their hands, stay home if they are sick and informing people of the coronavirus symptoms, similar to information health officials have publicly distributed or discussed. One official said staffers have appeared more attuned to their health amid the outbreak, wiping down desks with anti-bacterial wipes and being more careful about sneezing into a tissue or arm.  But aides have not received any formal guidance on workplace procedures if the virus escalates further, like lawmakers on Capitol Hill recently received, according to officials. The White House declined to identify any specific contingencies related to coronavirus and wouldn't say what steps are being taken to prevent Trump or Vice President Mike Pence -- who is leading the administration's response efforts -- from contracting the disease. Trump has received a yearly flu shot, but vaccines for coronavirus are still more than a year away, health experts have said. Last week, Pence shook hands in Florida with students at a military academy whose classmate was later quarantined because his mother had been in contact with someone who had coronavirus. The vice president's office said Pence never encountered the student in question. But the episode reflected the potential for transmission as top administration officials continue their travel around the country. Sticking to routine Publicly, Trump has shrugged off suggestions he alter his routine to avoid exposure to COVID-19. ""We lead a life. I get around,"" Trump told reporters over the weekend when asked whether he was taking any special precautions to avoid coming into contact with the virus. ""I think we're going to be in very good shape."" Officials said they had not noticed any changes in the ways Trump interacts with people he meets at the White House or on his trips around the country. Already, Trump was highly attuned to avoiding sick individuals and whatever germs they might be conveying. Trump himself played a role in personally removing his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney from his two-day trip to India last week because Mulvaney had a cold. According to one person close to Mulvaney, White House doctors advised against having him travel in such close proximity to the President and the first lady, but Trump was also uncomfortable being in such close proximity with someone who was ill. Mulvaney was subject to an on-camera scolding last year when Trump admonished him for coughing in the Oval Office as he was taping an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. ""I don't like that, you know, I don't like that,"" Trump said. ""If you're going to cough, please leave the room. You just can't, you just can't cough."" Trump's aides have learned to keep sanitizing gel and wipes nearby when the President is on the road. In October 2018, an image of the President climbing the stairs to Air Force One went viral because he appeared to have a piece of white toilet paper stuck to his shoe. An aide later clarified it was the anti-bacterial wipe the President uses after he shakes hands and greets supporters on the rope line at airports. For now, Trump has decided not to forgo political rallies, which can bring tens of thousands of his supporters into tightly packed arenas. He told reporters on Monday the events remain ""very safe"" for both him and his potential Democratic rivals to host, even as other large gatherings like conferences and summits in the United States are scrapped. On Tuesday, Trump said he was ""hearing more and more"" about potential risks related to coronavirus at his rallies, but said he wasn't considering a pause in his politicking. ""I don't think it would be necessary,"" he said. Rallying support The President's reelection campaign has followed Democratic candidates across the country as their primary season is underway. Right now, two aides said there are no plans for Trump to cancel any of his rallies because of the coronavirus, and several are currently in the works.  Trump traveled Monday to the 9,605-capacity Bojangles' Coliseum in Charlotte to host a rally ahead of North Carolina's Super Tuesday primary. ""We've got to all work together on this one to safeguard our people. We're going to safeguard our people,"" he told a packed-in crowd. Before taking the stage, the President took pictures with VIP supporters backstage, as he often does before rallies, offering a handshake and a few moments of up-close chit-chat. When Trump participates in photo-lines, an aide is usually nearby with a bottle of hand sanitizer to squirt into his palm whenever he requests it. While other major American companies, like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and CNN parent company Warner Media, have announced restrictions on employee travel, the White House hasn't taken those steps yet. On Friday, Trump is scheduled to visit tornado damage in Tennessee and the CDC headquarters in Atlanta, where he will undoubtedly encounter hands to shake. He is scheduled to speak at a public health conference in Orlando on Monday and will travel to the Republican Jewish Coalition conference next weekend in Las Vegas. A summit of Southeast Asian leaders had been scheduled to coincide with the Las Vegas trip but that was canceled amid coronavirus fears. And the White House has not announced any overseas travel for the President for the next few months. At least one of Trump's foreign counterparts -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel -- seemed momentarily caught off guard Tuesday when a government official refused her handshake during a cabinet meeting. Ending handshakes is likely a development Trump would welcome. ""One of the curses of American society is the simple act of shaking hands, and the more successful and famous one becomes the worse this terrible custom seems to get,"" he wrote in his 1997 book, ""The Art of the Comeback.""

Streaming could fill the stay-at-home void amid coronavirus fears,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/entertainment/streaming-and-coronavirus/index.html,"['http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/investing/coronavirus-stay-at-home-stocks/index.html', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/opinion/coronavirus-economy-amazon-uber.html']"," (CNN)Television has historically benefited from factors that prompt people to stay at home, from bad weather spells to terrorism to economic downturns. For a media industry undergoing a gradual evolution, the question is how much fears stoked by coronavirus will impact the investment in streaming. Actually, that's just one of the unknowns about media's future, which were percolating even before the threat of a pandemic entered the conversation. They include how willing consumers are to pay for an onslaught of new home-viewing services, and which existing alternatives will suffer -- including trips to movie theaters -- as a result. The stock market, already, is registering signs of how the smart money sees this playing out, at least in the near term. As CNN Business reported, ""stay at home"" stocks, like Netflix and Amazon (because of its home-delivery function, but it's in the streaming business too), have been early gainers as investors reallocate funds, while movie-theater chains, concert promoters and cruise lines have suffered. Netflix, of course, is the best-established streaming player, and the studios mounting challenges to it -- including Disney+, CBS All Access, and upcoming rivals from WarnerMedia and Comcast -- are betting that there will be more demand for the same. (CNN is a unit of WarnerMedia, whose service HBO Max launches later this year.) Those calculations, however, were based primarily on convenience, not fear. And while each of the streamers hopes to differentiate itself -- through a combination of original content and its programming library -- they are competing with other established forms of distribution, including movies cable, satellite and telephone companies. The potential impact of coronavirus, in this context, won't necessarily be in the near-term increase in people choosing to stay home on Friday or Saturday, opting to Netflix ( or Apple TV+ or Hulu, etc.) and chill, or not chill. The greater effect, rather, will be if that process hastens the shift toward watching entertainment on a solitary basis, dealing another blow -- perhaps a small but potentially significant one -- toward the communal experience. In the past, it's worth noting, spikes in at-home TV viewing tended to be cyclical. There would even be pent-up demand for getting out of the house once those factors that triggered a downturn passed, whether that meant an improving economy or waning fears of a perceived threat. The way streaming could alter that equation is in the quality and sheer tonnage of content. Even a 200-channel cable environment can be a little hit-miss in terms of whether a movie or show you want to watch happens to be on. The appeal of streaming is to make the whole menu available right here, right now. Will that make a difference? Will theaters struggle even more to get people, to paraphrase the old song, off the farm? As is so often the case with these things, we might not know until some time after things get back to normal -- or whatever passes for ""normal"" these days. Writing in the New York Times, Charlie Warzel said the virus could represent ""the first true test of the 21st-century way of life, laying bare the hidden fragility of a system that has long felt seamless."" One of the obvious short-term responses, it seems, would involve rewiring some of our connections -- including a shift from in-person assemblies to digital ones. What this ultimately comes down to is consumer behavior, and whether this confluence of events turns out to be a blip, or one that yields long-term consequences. The uncertainty and high level of fear associated with coronavirus will eventually be in the rear-view mirror. At some point after that, we'll have a sense of whether this period moved us closer, when it comes to the way we consume our entertainment, to being islands in the stream. "
Task force health expert contradicts Trump about coronavirus vaccine timing,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-vaccine-push-back/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/trump', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/us-coronavirus-politics-donald-trump-joe-biden-washington/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/politics/coronavirus-trump-cdc-timeline/', 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2020/03/politics/coronavirus-trump-cdc-timeline/']","Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump was contradicted by a health expert on his coronavirus task force over the timing for a potential vaccine during a briefing Monday. Trump was asked about a timeline for a vaccine during the Cabinet Room meeting with pharmaceutical executives and members of his task force. ""I don't know what the time will be. I've heard very quick numbers, that of months. And I've heard pretty much a year would be an outside number. So I think that's not a bad range. But if you're talking about three to four months in a couple of cases, a year in other cases,"" Trump said.  But Dr. Antony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, immediately corrected the President: ""Let me make sure you get the ... information. A vaccine that you make and start testing in a year is not a vaccine that's deployable.""  As Fauci explained the timeline, Trump folded his arms. Fauci said: ""So he's asking the question -- when is it going to be deployable? And that is going to be, at the earliest, a year to a year and a half, no matter how fast you go."" ""Do you think that's right?"" Trump asked the pharmaceutical executives at the table, just as Fauci finished speaking. ""Well, I think treatment in many ways might be more exciting."" The pushback didn't come just from Fauci.  Throughout the meeting, Trump was hyperfocused on pressing industry leaders in the room for a timeline for a coronavirus vaccine and treatment. But experts at the table -- from the administration and the pharmaceutical industry -- repeatedly emphasized that a vaccine can't be rushed to market before it's been declared safe for the public. ""So you're talking over the next few months, you could have a vaccine?"" Trump later asked Stéphane Bancel, the CEO of Moderna, a biotechnology company.  ""Correct, (for) phase two (testing),"" Bancel answered. Fauci interjected: ""He wouldn't have a vaccine. He'd have a vaccine to go into testing.""   Trump said: ""Oh, so you're talking in about a year."" Fauci said: ""A year to a year and a half."" The President said that one executive was ""talking about two months."" But Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar clarified that Regeneron, a biotechnology company that was represented in the room, would be ready for phase one testing for a vaccine in two months. Leonard Schleifer, the CEO of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, then underscored that ""vaccines have to be tested because there's precedent for vaccines to actually make diseases worse. ... You don't want to rush and treat a million people and find out you're making 900,000 of them worse."" ""That's a good idea,"" Trump said.  The President also said he agrees that any coronavirus vaccine has to be safe in order for it to be made widely available, but added: ""Get it done. We need it. We want it fast.""  Inovio CEO J. Joseph Kim, who was in the meeting, told CNN that Trump told the executives to contact him directly if they encountered holdups within the federal government. A source familiar with the administration's response said the scientists and experts gathered for the meeting were able to convince Trump that it will likely take a year or longer for an effective vaccine to be on the market.  ""I think he's got it now,"" the source said. CNN's Kevin Liptak and Jim Acosta contributed to this report."
South Korea pioneers coronavirus drive-through testing station,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/asia/coronavirus-drive-through-south-korea-hnk-intl/index.html,"['https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-02-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/01/asia/china-coronavirus-truth-rumors-intl-hnk/index.html']","Goyang, South Korea  (CNN)South Korea has come up with an innovative way of testing for the novel coronavirus -- and it was inspired by the drive-through counters at McDonalds and Starbucks, officials say. Here's how it works.  In the northern city of Goyang, drivers pull in to a parking lot where they are met by health workers dressed in hazmat suits.  Motorists then drive to several stations where nurses in protective plastic suits, masks and face shields register drivers, check their temperatures, and use swabs to take samples from their throats and nasal passages.  This is a drive-through coronavirus testing site.  Officials say it is safer and faster to test for the virus at the drive-through than in a hospital or health clinic.  ""There's less face-to-face contact,"" said Lee Jae-joon, the mayor of Goyang. ""If you operate a testing site indoors, there is concern that suspected patients can infect each other in the waiting room.""  ""Many drive-throughs at places like Starbucks have come to South Korea,"" he added, explaining that health officials were inspired to replicate their model.  At the drive-through, passengers and drivers go through the entire testing process in a matter of minutes without ever getting out of their cars.   That limits the exposure of frontline workers to the virus, says Lee Eun-sook, a surgeon volunteering at the test site, and means patients aren't able to contaminate a public health facility.  Pressure on health system The novel coronavirus outbreak is putting pressure on the Korean health system.  The number of confirmed cases has surged from 31 to more than 4,200 in two weeks, and at least 26 people have been killed by the disease in the country. In response to the crisis, South Korea has more than 500 coronavirus testing sites, which have screened more than 100,000 people. When the drive-through opened on February 26, it was the first of its kind in the country and has tested as many as 384 people in one day. Results come back within three days, and are sent by SMS. Health workers screen visitors with a questionnaire about their travel history and symptoms. Only those deemed to be at-risk will be tested.  Those who have visited Daegu, for example, are deemed more vulnerable, as 73% of all coronavirus cases in the country stem from this southern city, according to South Korea's Center for Disease Control and Prevention.  Similarly, those who have links to the Shincheonji religious group in Daegu, connected to more than 50% of cases in the country, are deemed to be at risk.  About 100 workers in a gymnasium across the street from the drive-through site have been tasked with tracking down the 3,600 Shincheonji members believed to be living in Goyang.   Tough conditions One down-side to the drive-through test site is the Korean winter weather. ""It's hard because we have to wear protective suits, we can't go to the bathroom or drink water, and it's cold,"" says nurse Park Seung-hee, who normally works at the city's health center. As cars coasted past, she and other nurses huddled by gas heaters, cupping heated pads in their hands.  They work here in five-hour shifts. When their shifts ends, they step fully clothed into a small portable booth called the ""Clean Zone,"" in which they are showered in hypochlorous acid disinfectant. It is all in a day's work at the drive through. "

The National Basketball Association advised its players to restrict physical contact with fans as a precaution to limit potential exposure to coronavirus, according to a league memo obtained by CNN.  There are currently 102 cases of the novel coronavirus nationwide, according to federal and state health officials. The best ways to avoid transmission include avoiding sick people, covering coughs and sneezes and washing hands.  The memo suggests that players ""fist bump"" fans in lieu of a ""high-five"" and avoid items handed to them by fans for autographs like pens, markers, balls or jerseys. ""The health and safety of NBA players, coaches, staff, and fans is paramount. Working with infectious disease experts, the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are providing the following information for players related to the coronavirus outbreak,"" the memo says.

The virus has spread to every continent except Antarctica since it was first identified in December last year in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. Medical workers are now battling deadly outbreak clusters in South Korea, Iran and Italy, while other countries are working furiously to avoid a similar fate by readying public health authorities, alerting their citizens and enacting travel restrictions to affected areas.  To date, there have been 172 deaths reported outside mainland China, raising the global death toll to 3,115.  Several nations that have seen cases are putting in place measures to limit the virus' spread: closing schools, encouraging remote work and canceling or scaling back public events, just to name a few.  The WHO has so far held off on classifying the incident as a global pandemic, but has warned it is a possibility in the near future.  ""We have never before seen a respiratory pathogen that is capable of community transmission, but which can also be contained with the right measures,"" said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the global health watchdog. Investors are also bracing for the possibility that the spread of COVID-19, as the virus is formally known, could throw the global economy into recession. Its spread in China, the world's second-biggest economy and a major manufacturer, was followed by factory closures that severely impacted global supply chains. At least 80,151 cases have been identified in mainland China to date, killing 2,943 people.  However, the economic effects of the virus now go beyond China, as the virus is impacting business operations and consumer behavior worldwide. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that the virus plunged the world economy into its worst downturn since the 2009 global financial crisis and that growth could be cut in half if the outbreak continues unabated. Major clusters outside China Cases outside mainland China appear to be spreading faster than inside, as the outbreak shows signs of stabilizing in parts of the country, following weeks of restrictions and emergency measures. The WHO's Ghebreyesus said on Monday that ""in the last 24 hours, there were almost nine times more COVID-19 cases reported outside China than inside.""  According to China's National Health Commission (NHC) confirmed cases in mainland China increased by 125 Monday. Of those cases, 114 were in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the provincial capital. China's two most populous cities, Shanghai and Beijing, have enforced quarantines for people who recently visited countries with significant outbreaks.  South Korea, Iran and Italy are facing the most severe outbreaks excluding mainland China. Authorities in Seoul said Tuesday that more than 4,800 infections had been identified, killing 28 people. Italian officials have reported at least 1,835 infected patients and 52 deaths. And Iran has announced at least 2,336 cases and 77 deaths -- including an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Several of Iran's neighbors have taken steps to avoid the spread, including closing borders with the country. Authorities in Europe are also taking early precautions. Several governments are preventing large gatherings of people in order to curb community transmission, as well as closing public spaces like the Louvre in Paris and Milan's La Scala opera. Crowded events like the Paris half-marathon have been canceled. And one French official advised against a long-time French greeting of two kisses on the cheek to avoid close physical contact. The European Union's alert level for the novel coronavirus has been raised from moderate to high, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a Monday news conference. There are more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the EU, with the bulk of the outbreak happening in Italy. The United States has also seen an uptick in cases, with more than 100 infections now identified after a surge of new patients Washington state, where six people have been killed. Four of the people who died were residents of a nursing care facility in Kirkland, in suburban Seattle, eliciting concerns that the virus may have spread within Washington in recent days or weeks. Washington remains the only state in the US where the spread of the virus has resulted in fatalities.  The new cases have prompted private companies to take their own proactive measures. Twitter is asking its employees to work from home, Carnival Cruise lines is changing some of its itineraries and the NBA is asking its players to avoid taking items from fans to autograph and offer strangers fist-bumps instead of high-fives. However, federal public health authorities have issued several calls for calm. US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said the government ""knew this was coming."" ""Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not,"" he said. President Donald Trump said Monday he was still considering additional travel restrictions from countries with rampant coronavirus outbreaks. Vice President Mike Pence, who was appointed to the head of President Trump's coronavirus task force, said new travel advisories have been put in place for Italy and South Korea, and anyone traveling to the United States on a flight from Italy and South Korea will receive multiple screenings before arriving in the United States.  But he also advised Americans that the virus does not pose a major threat to them. ""Let's be clear: The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low, according to all of the experts that we are working with across the government,"" Pence said.

Contingency planning at JPMorgan's (JPM) consumer bank, code-named ""Project Kennedy,"" included asking 10% of the staff to work from home for a day to test their remote access capabilities, the person told CNN Business.

And JPMorgan is also preparing for the risk that the coronavirus outbreak disrupts its primary trading floors in New York and London.  In recent days, the company has been testing backup trading sites and soon plans to send in parts of its trading teams to test the facilities, the source said.  JPMorgan declined to comment. The move comes amid industry-wide concerns on how -- and how badly --  the coronavirus might affect the financial industry.  On Monday, a day when the Dow had the biggest point gain in its history, the free stock-trading app Robinhood experienced a 17-hour disruption. The company's system went down again Tuesday, but the situation was resolved by around noon.   Other major companies are responding to the outbreak by restricting travel and canceling appearances at events.  Google and Facebook (FB) have pulled the plug on major conferences, and coronavirus concerns led to the cancellation of the Geneva car show.  And the New York Stock Exchange said last week that it has robust contingency plans that enable it to maintain continuous operation of exchanges if facilities are impacted by the coronavirus.  "

Follow her on Twitter @HalfSickShadows. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.  (CNN)The way we talk about disease can actually alter how diseases spread. As medical humanities scholar Heather Schell has said, the practice of epidemiology links statistical analysis and pattern formation with the creation of narratives about the impact disease may have on the world. Interacting as they do with pathogens, these narratives themselves can shape the ebb and flow of pathogens for better or worse, as people change their behaviors in response to epidemiological reporting.   In the midst of a coronavirus epidemic, we're likely to continue to be inundated with statistics, charts and maps tracking the pathogen. It can be easy to forget in this context of global fear, especially given the likelihood that the number of coronavirus cases in the United States will spike now that testing is more widely available in individual states, that what we are really talking about when we talk about disease is people. That is, the reason we care about disease is because we care about the people it may harm, and therefore epidemiology is as much about people as about disease.  In her 2008 book ""Contagious,"" Priscilla Wald coined the term ""outbreak narrative"" to describe the way we talk about emerging infectious diseases (EID); she argues that concepts such as ""Patient Zero,"" and ""Typhoid Marys"" (i.e., healthy carriers) can make a good, comprehensible story out of a chaotic reality, but can actually hinder our ability to fight disease. Numerous outbreaks throughout history have demonstrated, for instance, that when society hopes that a disease will stay ensconced in some ""other"" population, humanity creates what I call a ""social spillover event."" We saw this with the AIDS crisis in the 1980s: The more some Americans insisted HIV was a disease exclusive to the homosexual population, the more, in fact, it spread, among heterosexuals, blood transfusion recipients and the like. To this day, advertisements about HIV preventative medication predominantly feature gay men, perpetuating the myth that other populations need not worry. But microbes will call our bluff every time. They don't care about our social strata: A body is a body is a body, and the longer we pretend HIV won't be a problem for the broader community, the longer HIV has (and had) time to spread. In the 1880s, the disease of the day was syphilis. Victorians largely believed that only sex workers were responsible for the disease's spread, not their customers. Acting upon this logic, public health measures regarding syphilis were aimed at this population. Unsurprisingly, more and more unwitting housewives and their babies nevertheless began to show signs of syphilis brought home by husbands who had solicited sex workers. The notion that only some people were prone to an illness allowed syphilis to spread so widely in Britain that many became concerned for the future security of the nation. In fact, the very widespread acceptance of germ theory itself hinged on debates amongst obstetricians about whether or not doctors might have been responsible for the rampant spread of group A streptococcal infections in postpartum women. As doctors in the mid-19th century refused to believe that male medical authority could be a vector of bacteria, women continued to die. Ignaz Semmelweis tracked this epidemiological data and used it to prove germ theory's veracity. His name is still memorized by medical students.  Polio, which had been fairly endemic (naturally occurring at low rates) the world over as far back as we have records, began to be framed as an urgent public health crisis when it affected affluent American communities, which helped fuel the development of a world-changing vaccine. History would indicate that it should come as no surprise that Monday, the World Health Organization director stated that during the previous 24 hours ""there were almost nine times more Covid-19 cases reported outside China than inside."" The great thing about living in a virally networked society in a time of viral outbreak is we have the chance to shape our ""outbreak narrative"" with intention. Even as scientists, doctors, the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States (among many other entities) are doing their own work to combat the novel coronavirus, listening to the voices of professionals in fields such as bioethics and the medical humanities -- many of whom are active and vocal on social media -- can help the lay public in the present, not just in historical retrospect, if we learn from these retrospective lessons.  There has been a lot of media focus on the Wuhan wet market responsible for this outbreak. These historical examples of disease should urge us to look equally (and now) at the human factors involved in the spread of coronavirus and the xenophobic fears associated with it, because these beliefs impact disease spread. What affects one of us affects us all when it comes to disease, whether we like it or not. The WHO and global experts are working to combat this disease in the best ways they know how. In the meantime, the general public also has a role to combat misguided fears that perpetuate and possibly even help spread diseases like this. We live in a global neighborhood with one another and with microbes, and given that context, it might be more useful to ask questions like ""How can I help?"" The financial market's profound upheaval and the sudden and recent overbuying of everything from masks to hand sanitizer seem to be at least in part made worsened by an initial belief that coronavirus was something like a foreign or alien invasion, something from without that could be stopped from within. In fact, our health care system is woefully unprepared compared to other nations' -- and we never were exempt; some of our most xenophobic citizens only acted as though thinking that would make it so. And that itself may have enabled an American passivity that helped the disease to get and spread here to begin with. We would do well, then, to learn from history now, so we don't have to wonder later what we might have done better. Because history has shown us over and over again that only by avoiding our knee-jerk instinct at isolated self-protectionism and instead leaning into the shared risk that we all in fact have in a globalized society, can we more quickly ameliorate the effects of pathogens before they fester and emerge in new outbreaks.

US officials want more traveler information from airlines to aid coronavirus response,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/politics/us-officials-airlines-collect-traveler-data/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-02-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/us-coronavirus-cases-monday/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/health/coronavirus-airport-screening-expansion-cdc/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/19/health/coronavirus-airport-temperature-checks/index.html']"," (CNN)US officials are pressing airlines to collect and share more data on international travelers with federal health officials combating the coronavirus, two officials tell CNN. The matter has been a focal point of discussions between US officials and major airlines ahead of Vice President Mike Pence's meeting with airline representatives this week, and officials said the issue will likely be a focus of the meeting unless the matter is resolved ahead of time. The data request includes contact information that would help health officials follow up with potential carriers of the coronavirus, or fellow travelers who may have come into contact with an infected person.   The request itself is outlined in an interim final rule the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Department of Health and Human Services issued in mid-February. It requests airlines provide, within 24 hours of a CDC request, each passenger's name, ""address while in the United States,"" email address and both a primary and secondary phone number. The complication, according to an industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that many air carriers don't currently collect some of the contact details the CDC is requesting. Bookings made through a third-party search engine, for example, may include very limited information about a passenger. Currently, airlines are required to respond to a public health-related request only with the passenger contact information they have, as well as details about the specific flight and even seat number. The new proposal will make collection of this information mandatory.   CDC said in the proposal the information currently available is not necessarily ""timely, complete, or accurate,"" and even collecting supplementary information from the Department of Homeland Security, which processes international travelers, does not adequately ""fill the gaps.""    It can take government officials ""nearly two weeks"" to compile contact information using the current requirements, according to the proposal. That is same amount of time that it takes coronavirus to incubate in a patient. The rule does not specify how the airlines must collect the data, but it does acknowledge that ""a certain amount of modification to airlines' information systems will be necessitated.""  The department is taking public comment on the proposal until March 13. The vice president's office did not immediately provide a comment to CNN. Rep. Rick Larsen, chairman of an aviation subcommittee on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said ""that's difficult to do"" when asked about the possibility of collecting more passenger data because the airlines don't collect the information the government wants. ""I don't think it's necessary to do that,"" Larsen said, adding he's been told it's a ""trial balloon.""  He said to accomplish that, ""we would have to establish an entirely new process -- entirely new software system to make that request. Collect it, provide it. And the question is whether that would be necessary to address the problem.""  Also, a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee is holding a hearing with the airlines Wednesday. Sen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington state, ranking Democrat on the full committee, told CNN she is sending letters to the airlines over the next day to get more information about the stances they are taking.

Vaccine affordability a last sticking point in coronavirus funding package talks in Congress,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/politics/coronavirus-funding-fight-congress/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/coronavirus-funding-congress-bipartisan-agreement-close/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/politics/coronavirus-capitol-hill-briefing-concern/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/politics/coronavirus-congress-white-house/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/26/politics/coronavirus-funding-request-schumer-congress/index.html']"," (CNN)Congressional negotiators as of Tuesday afternoon have not finalized a multi-billion supplemental spending bill to respond to the coronavirus outbreak in the US and a final sticking point revolves around how to make an eventual vaccine affordable, according to senators and aides in each party. ""Democrats have been pushing for strong provisions to ensure the vaccine is available and affordable to everyone who needs it,"" said a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations. LIVE UPDATES: Coronavirus outbreak spreads across the world But some Republicans are worried that any sort of price controls on the vaccine could curb a robust market-based response by pharmaceutical companies to find a cure.  ""I don't think it's a legitimate sticking point. There is not an example of a vaccine developed for a pandemic that's ever not been made available in a reasonable way to people,"" said Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican from Missouri who chairs the health subcommittee on appropriations.   Top negotiators from across Congress and from both parties have worked for days to pull together funding package to combat the disease. It still remains to be seen how much the deal will be worth. But sources told CNN over the weekend it could exceed $7 billion, a level far higher than the $2.5 billion White House request. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $8.5 billion to deal with the outbreak last week.  The top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee said Tuesday that Democrats are wary of drug companies earning big profits from a vaccine.  ""In our discussion in the Appropriations Committee, we have talked about the fact that millions and millions of dollars -- possibly hundreds of millions of taxpayers' dollars -- are going to go into developing the vaccine and test kits,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, a Democrat from Vermont. ""We are not going to say to the drug companies after the taxpayers have paid for this, now go out and make a huge profit. That's not going to happen."" The top Republican on the Appropriations Committee said he hoped to resolve the issue quickly so Congress can pass a bill quickly, possibly by the end of the week.  Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said making sure poorer Americans can afford the vaccine is a top priority for him.  ""I really believe that no one, no American, should be denied vaccine because they have no money to pay for it.  Because this is life or death situation,"" Shelby said. ""I think we can work together and cover a lot of that. I want to do that."" Asked if he was open to setting aside a fund of up to $500 million for such a purpose, he responded: ""We are trying to get to yes."" Congressional leaders hope to have a deal by the end of the day Tuesday.  Democrats press Pence over coronavirus In a sign of tensions over the spread of coronavirus on Capitol Hill, a number of Democratic senators, including Jon Tester of Montana, Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Mark Warner of Virginia signaled unease with the US response as they emerged from a briefing with Vice President Mike Pence on the issue during the Senate Democratic lunch. ""No,"" Tester said when asked if the US is prepared, arguing the President ""dropped the ball early"" and there are ""not enough test kits"" available.  ""We have a long ways to go to get to where we need to be,"" Tester said.  Reed said the US is not prepared: ""I think there's an attempt to minimize -- not to be realistic in the assessment."" Warner said he's concerned about the impact the coronavirus could have on federal employees. Asked if he's satisfied with the administration's response to date, Warner said: ""It's a work in progress."" Sen. Maria Cantwell, a Democrat from Washington state, said that she and others pressed Pence about the number of tests that are available -- and said the US government needs to come up with a ""more aggressive"" plan. Pence responded by saying that the FDA announced last Saturday that it was expanding the tests by letting academic and commercial labs do the testing as well as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Cantwell. But she said that Democrats were not satisfied. ""They made this big move on Saturday through the FDA but I think they keep throwing out numbers like millions of tests ... That's not right,"" Cantwell said. ""Millions of tests are not available right this second. And people are calling their doctors and they're not able to get a test."" Cantwell added, ""So let's get crisper and clearer about what the process is for people to get testing and when the availability of those tests will be there for them."" Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan said that ample concerns were raised that people are told to stay home from work but when they try to get tested, there are no available tests. ""He said he realized that was a concern,"" Stabenow said, characterizing Pence's response. Stabenow also said that Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon raised concerns that ICE agents could arrest undocumented immigrants who are carrying the virus but may be worried about getting treated. She said the US government needs to send a different message to the public on that. Asked how Pence responded to the question, Stabenow said: ""He did not. He said he appreciated the question.""

The company has decided not to attend this year's South by Southwest (SXSW) conference in Austin, Texas, it confirmed on Monday.  ""Due to concerns related to coronavirus, our company and employees will not be participating in SXSW this year,"" a Facebook (FB) spokesperson told CNN Business.  Founded in 1987, SXSW brings together some of the biggest names in technology, film, media and music in Austin each year. It occasionally helps usher in tech's next big thing, with notable beneficiaries including Twitter and Foursquare.  Twitter (TWTR), which announced over the weekend that it would suspend all ""non-critical business travel and events"" and is encouraging employees to work from home, will also give the conference a miss. A Twitter spokesperson told CNN Business that the company's travel restrictions include SXSW, where CEO Jack Dorsey was scheduled to speak.  The coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide so far, including six in the United States, and has caused major disruptions to the global economy, including the tech industry. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have warned that the virus will result in a hit to their sales, and major events including the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona and the annual Game Developers Conference have been canceled or postponed. Facebook has also axed two of its own events this year, including an advertising conference last month and F8, its biggest annual gathering, due to take place in May.

The Fed's first emergency action since the global financial crisis was announced just hours after finance officials from the seven largest advanced economies said they were ready to act to soften the blow to businesses and households. Investors had expected the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, but not until later this month. The US central bank said the surprise move was a response to the ""evolving risks to economic activity"" posed by the continued spread of the virus outside China. Earlier, G7 finance officials participated in a conference call led by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The G7 issued a joint statement that committed them to using ""all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth"" but stopped short of outlining specific steps. Speaking after the US rate cut, Powell indicated other central banks could follow with action of their own. Analysts say the European Central Bank and the Bank of England could cut rates when they meet later this month. ""We expect similar efforts by monetary authorities around the world, with many governments also likely stepping in with fiscal stimulus as well,"" Atsi Sheth, chief credit officer for the Americas at Moody's Investor Service, said in a research note.  The market response to the G7 statement earlier Tuesday was muted because it did not outline coordinated monetary policy moves on rates or fiscal policy. Capital Economics said the statement added ""little to what we had already heard from national central banks and governments."" ""This is a disappointment compared to previous hopes of an immediate and coordinated fiscal package and interest rate cut,"" the firm's analysts wrote in a research note. Stocks had rallied sharply Monday, rebounding from their worst rout since the global financial crisis last week on hopes that governments and central banks around the world would move quickly to prevent fallout from the epidemic causing a deep economic downturn. European stocks held onto slim gains at the close Tuesday.  Analysts at Deutsche Bank said earlier Tuesday that G7 countries would need more time to settle on a ""truly"" coordinated response to coronavirus. Sebastien Galy, a strategist at Nordea Asset Management, had also played down the chances of a coordinated monetary response at this stage because the G7 economies face different threats from coronavirus. Coronavirus fears There have now been more than 90,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide, with infections on every continent except Antarctica. The virus has killed over 3,100 people as it spreads. South Korea has over 5,100 cases and 29 deaths. Six patients have died in the United States. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that global economic growth could be cut in half this year if the outbreak continues to spread. It called for an immediate response to contain the outbreak, recommending that governments increase spending and central banks implement policies to help cushion the blow from the virus. Some central banks in smaller economies have already cut rates, while others have sought to reassure investors that they're prepared to limit the economic fallout. The Bank of Japan has said it would provide ""ample liquidity"" to keep financial markets stable, and the European Central Bank on Monday said it stands ""ready to take appropriate and targeted measures."" Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said Tuesday that the central bank would take ""all necessary steps to support the UK economy and financial system"" through an economic shock ""that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary."" But questions remain about how much policymakers can really do to mitigate the coronavirus shock to the economy, raising the possibility that any stabilization in markets will be short-lived. Interest rate cuts, analysts suggest, are not the best way to fight a global health crisis.  Central banks also have far less ammunition to deploy than they did a decade ago. Interest rates are already at or near record lows, and central bank balance sheets have swollen by trillions of dollars during years of asset purchases, limiting the options to create even more cheap money. — Eoin McSweeney and Julia Horowitz contributed reporting.

A Wuhan evacuee was released from quarantine in Texas and later tested positive for the coronavirus,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/02/health/wuhan-evacuee-san-antonio/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/asia/japan-diamond-princess-quarantine-crew-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/us/us-coronavirus-case-texas-base/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/10/us/coronavirus-american-evacuees-release/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/health/us-coronavirus-test-kits/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/health/us-cases-coronavirus-community-transmission/index.html']"," (CNN)A woman in San Antonio who had previously tested negative twice for the coronavirus and was released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is back in quarantine after a subsequent test came back positive. Hours before declaring a public health emergency, Mayor Ron Nirenberg called the patient's release a federal ""screw-up"" during a news conference and is requesting that Americans evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship to San Antonio continue to be held until retesting shows they're negative for the virus. About 122 people from the ship are being quarantined, he said later in a CNN interview. Their quarantine was scheduled to end Monday. In addition, San Antonio Metropolitan Health District director Dawn Emerick is asking that the CDC change its protocol to add a third consecutive negative test before releasing people into the community, she said.  The woman, who was evacuated from Wuhan, China, to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio on a flight chartered by the State Department, was released from the Texas Center for Infectious Disease on Saturday, according to San Antonio's mayor, who does not affiliate with either major party. The patient was part of the original group of 91 people evacuated to San Antonio from Wuhan, Nirenberg said, expressing dismay that a patient was released into the community while her test results were pending.  ""I find it totally unacceptable that CDC would release a patient prior to releasing all test results and potentially expose the public to this harm,"" he said. ""Local health professionals, in whom I have the utmost confidence, are working very hard to prevent the spread of this virus here in San Antonio, and we simply cannot have a screw-up like this from our federal partners."" The patient was out in the community for about 12 hours and visited a hotel near the airport and then, from about 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Saturday, the North Star Mall, where she mostly sat by herself in the food court, said Dr. Anita Kurlan, assistant director with the Metropolitan Health District. The risk of exposure at both locations is deemed low, she said.  City health officials have requested a deep cleaning of the mall, she said. At the hospital, officials identified 16 people who were in contact with the patient after she was prematurely cleared, and two of them are considered at medium risk for exposure. The rest are considered low risk, Kurlan said.  The San Antonio case highlights concerns about testing procedures, including a flaw in test kits distributed by the CDC, a change in CDC criteria for diagnosing the virus and the limited number of labs able to perform testing.  Officials from San Antonio and Bexar County released a CDC statement that said the person had been in quarantine for several weeks and tested negative for coronavirus on at least two occasions.  The person was released after meeting the CDC's criteria for release, which includes resolution of any symptoms and two consecutive negative tests collected more than 24 hours apart. ""At the time of discharge from the facility, the patient was asymptomatic and met all of CDC's criteria for release,"" the CDC statement said.   Following her release, a subsequent sample showed a weak positive. She was taken back into isolation at a local medical facility, the statement said. It's unclear why the additional test was performed. CNN's calls to the CDC have not been returned. ""The discharged patient had some contact with others while out of isolation, and CDC and local public health partners are following up to trace possible exposures and notify them of their potential risk,"" the statement said. Local officials are concerned that the person's release could have exposed the community. However, the individual is not showing any symptoms, according to the local officials. ""This has been our biggest concern and now we will experience the consequences of no action,"" Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff, a Democrat, said in the joint statement. ""Time and time again, I have raised issues concerning evacuees, inappropriate accommodations, the risk of exposure during transporting and the need for additional monitoring and extended quarantine periods."" Wolff told CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that he and the mayor wrote a letter to federal officials asking that these people stay in quarantine. ""We are doing everything we can to protect our citizens. We've done everything we can to help those that really have a serious case. But we've had no cooperation with the CDC, with the federal government, with the Department of Defense. They're just not listening to us,"" he said. Wolff said the woman actually first tested positive, then twice tested negative, and it was a fourth test that was positive. The woman released by the CDC was one of 11 presumptive positive cases her department is monitoring, Metropolitan Health District spokeswoman Michelle Vigil said. Nine of the patients were evacuated from a cruise ship, one person was evacuated from Wuhan, and another was transferred from quarantine in Miramar, California, Vigil told CNN in an email. Diagnosing patients has been problematic. Early in the outbreak, the CDC issued guidance saying potential patients needed either to have traveled to China or to have been in close contact with someone who visited in China before being tested. New criteria were issued after a patient from Northern California contracted the illness, despite meeting neither prerequisite.  This came two weeks after several states reported that some CDC test kits weren't working properly, forcing the center to remake parts of the test. Health experts also have expressed concerns about a dearth of test kits.  The federal government is working to bolster its testing capabilities, mailing more than 15,000 test kits to local and state labs over the weekend, Vice President Mike Pence said. Also, where there was only one CDC facility that could test for the virus in the early weeks of the outbreak, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last week there are now dozens of labs capable of doing the tests.  CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report. "

Phillips, MD, is an assistant professor of emergency medicine at the George Washington University, where he serves as chief of the Section of Disaster and Operational Medicine. Follow him on Twitter @DrPhillipsMD. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.  (CNN)I wholeheartedly agree with those experts who go beyond the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and are now calling Covid-19 a pandemic. With evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission on multiple continents, it's time to stop focusing on containment and work instead to harden our domestic healthcare infrastructure.   As an emergency physician at an urban hospital in Washington, DC, this is personal. My colleagues and I will be on the front lines as American emergency agencies will soon likely experience a large and sustained surge of patients with Covid-19 concerns. The public should find comfort that health experts have been preparing for weeks. There is, however, still much work to be done.  I will likely become infected in the next few months. It's just simple math that I have accepted. But I became a physician knowing the job incurred risk and that I have a duty to patients and society. Based on what we know today, my risk of getting severely ill or dying from Covid-19 is low. I am fortunate to be relatively young and healthy, but that is not the case for other medical colleagues who are likely to become infected as well.  Protecting our workforce is critical. Healthcare workers who are infected or exposed without protective gear won't be able to work while contagious. Yet we need them to care for new Covid-19 cases as well as patients with all of the other diseases and traumatic injuries that will continue to occur. Heart attacks and strokes are not taking a break while the virus is here. How can we be proactive about protecting our healthcare workers? To start, we need to consider protecting our older colleagues and those with certain preexisting medical conditions. We may even need to decide that only young and healthy doctors and nurses should be triaging and caring for these patients. I'm in. But is this discriminatory or putting too much risk on the young? I'm not sure.   As the novel coronavirus spreads, we can be certain that a number of medical staff will need to miss work because they or their families are ill. What we don't yet know is for how long. It is imperative that we fund research to determine how long the infected are contagious and when people can safely return to work so that we can keep our healthcare systems working and our economy from suffering.  Telemedicine can play a major role in this outbreak by allowing providers to avoid proximate risk of infection while electronically visiting large numbers of patients daily. Even infected or exposed doctors can ""stay in the fight"" by performing telemedicine visits while quarantined.  In addition to concerns about infection among the workforce, space in emergency departments will be an issue. Most urban emergency departments are already operating at maximum capacity every day.  As a disaster medicine specialist, my biggest concern is that ERs and clinics could become overwhelmed by the ""worried well"" and the minimally ill. Unnecessary visits by those with mild viral illness risks not only exposure to other ED patients, but also increases the risk of illness to the medical staff. In addition, if our ambulances are busy transporting patients who are only worried or mildly ill, they will have slower response times to critically ill patients who truly need paramedic care. It is possible that people could die from health system disruption without ever having contracted the actual virus. An EMS delay of only a few minutes could mean that those having heart attacks, strokes, diabetic emergencies, opiate overdoses and trauma have a higher risk of death.  Because of these concerns, the public should expect to be asked in the coming weeks to avoid health system visits unless they have significant symptoms or risk factors. I suggest that healthcare facilities explore the creation of separate care areas for patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and possible Covid-19 in an effort to keep all those possibly contagious away from those being seen for other conditions.  We must ensure the public knows we are open and preventing spread from one patient to another. Don't be surprised if your local ED will need to add temporary structures such as a large outdoor tent to evaluate those concerned that they have been exposed to the coronavirus.   While healthcare workers and policymakers are currently laser-focused on Covid-19, the epidemic requires a coordinated response that extends beyond the healthcare system. Elected and appointed leaders must communicate with the public clearly, honestly and often. Healthcare experts should be a key part of this communication. Meanwhile, employers large and small must enact public health measures, part of which should include requirements that sick employees stay home and guarantees that they will not be penalized for doing so.  Should people wear surgical masks when they go out? Yes, if you have even a mild cough. This will minimize infected droplets from your mouth and nose. Staying home if possible is preferable. Washing your hands often is essential. But remember that masks offer minimal protection to the individual. Surgical masks (the ""blue ones"") are not designed to filter the air you breathe -- they are designed to catch droplets of the person wearing it, primarily to keep surgeons from contaminating a surgical site.  Even the special N-95 filter masks, designed to be true virus protection and now in short supply, are effective only if properly fitted and worn over clean-shaven faces. To those in healthcare -- get fit-tested immediately, shave your beards and resist the temptation to hoard the masks at home. Hospitals will need these masks on hand and must immediately enact measures to ensure that mask theft is eliminated.  I get asked several times per day, ""Should I be worried?"" The answer is yes, but only to an appropriate degree. This will get worse before it gets better. We don't know if it will go away when it gets warm (keep an eye on transmission in the tropics), nor do we know for sure if reinfection is possible.  One thing is certain: panic helps nobody. Heed the advice of medical professionals, not social media. Trust the US CDC recommendations and be confident in the fact that every physician, nurse, EMS worker and healthcare administrator is giving Covid-19 their fullest attention.  "

The conversations among Democrats remain informal, DNC officials say, but Democrats are starting to monitor the spread of the virus -- with an eye, specifically, on how it would hamper plans to bring thousands of top Democrats together in July to nominative the party's standard bearer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""Conventions always have contingency plans in place,"" said Mari Cardona, a member of the DNC. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Cardona, who is a member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee, added that informal conversations have begun, but the DNC has not ""had any conversations about changing the rules at this point."" The same is true for the Republicans, who -- according to a RNC spokeswoman -- are monitoring the spread of the virus and how it could impact their August convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""The Convention Team is closely monitoring and coordinating with key stakeholders across the administration, HHS, and CDC to obtain regular updates,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We prioritize the health and safety of attendees and have the utmost confidence in the administration's work and preparations."" The prospect of coronavirus impacting a nominating convention shows how disruptive the novel coronavirus outbreak could be to major political events around the country this election year. An altered convention could be a disappointment for both parties, in large part because of the television coverage they receive. So far, with a growing outbreak of coronavirus in the United States, health experts have said that avoiding large crowds where the virus could spread is a good idea for older people, who appear to be more vulnerable, and some major gatherings, such as industry conferences and international summits, have been scrapped. Still, President Donald Trump has defended continuing to hold his rallies, sporting and entertainment events in the US are proceeding as planned and Democratic presidential candidates continue to host their own events. Max Everett, vice president of the RNC's national organizing group, told reporters on Monday that the party is ""working with key stakeholders in the administration, as well as a lot of state, federal and local partners."" ""We're going to prioritize the health and safety of all attendees and travelers,"" he said. ""We have a lot of faith and confidence in the work the administration is doing right now."" The spread of the coronavirus also came up during a call between members of the executive committee of the Association of State Democratic Committees, a DNC official said. Coronavirus was not the focus of the call, but it did come up during a question and answer session. Concerns among DNC members were first reported by The Daily Beast. Joe Solmonese, the CEO of the convention, said ""ensuring the safety of convention attendees and local residents is -- and will always remain -- our top priority."" ""Every convention necessitates developing a number of contingency plans to provide for a variety of scenarios. As we prepare to welcome Americans to Milwaukee this summer, the convention team will remain in constant communication with the local, state, and federal authorities responsible for protecting public health and security,"" said Solmonese. ""We will continue to monitor this developing situation closely and follow the guidance of the CDC and state and local health officials in the days and weeks ahead.""  "
Don't try to make your own hand sanitizer just because there's a shortage from coronavirus,2020-03-03,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/health/coronavirus-diy-hand-sanitizer-trnd/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/28/business/hand-sanitizers-wipes-cvs-walgreens-coronavirus/index.html', 'https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf', 'https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/show-me-the-science-hand-sanitizer.html', 'https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19', 'https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/14/health/hand-sanitizer-poisoning/index.html']"," (CNN)As anxiety surrounding the novel coronavirus swirls in the US, some stores are struggling to keep up with the demand for hand sanitizer. With the shelves empty and online pharmacies out of stock, people have resorted to making their own. But think twice about joining them -- experts are wary and even caution against the idea.  Recipes for DIY hand sanitizer are popping all over the internet. A quick search reveals news articles, YouTube how-to's and step-by-step visual guides.  The World Health Organization even has an official guide to making hand sanitizer. But it's intended for populations that do not have clean water or other medical-grade products in place.  If made correctly, DIY solution could be helpful and even effective. But if made incorrectly, it can be downright harmful.  ""I worry about people making their own sanitizer as it will be difficult to make sure that the concentrations are correct,"" Daniel Parker, assistant professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, told CNN of the trend. For hand sanitizer to be effective, it must have at least 60% alcohol content, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Store-bought hand sanitizers will also often have emollients to counter the harshness of the alcohol on the skin. If you don't have that in your homemade recipe, you could risk hurting your hands, Sally Bloomfield, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the Guardian. Like store-bought sanitizer, homemade sanitizer would be something you'd want to keep out of the reach of young children, too.  A 2015 analysis by the Georgia Poison Center found poison control center hotlines across the US had seen a nearly 400% increase in calls related to children younger than 12 ingesting the product. Ingesting even small amounts -- as little as two or three squirts in some cases -- can cause alcohol poisoning. Just wash your hands The best way to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus is still with good old water and soap.  Parker advises that people wash their hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching their face, cover their mouth when sneezing or coughing, and regularly clean surfaces.  But if you're in a bind and have to use hand sanitizer, there's a correct way to do that as well.  Whether it's a spray-type hand sanitizer or gel, make sure both of your hands are covered -- including between the fingers and under the nails -- and rubbed until dry. Also, if your hands are visibly dirty or greasy, hand sanitizer may not be as effective, according to the CDC.  "

Just what you need to hear first thing in the morning!  Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Election 2020 It's Super Tuesday, the day that 14 states and one US territory go to the polls for the largest single day of contests in the election season so far. Voters will be looking at an even thinner ballot after Democratic presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race yesterday, following sixth-place finishes in Nevada and South Carolina. Within hours of shuttering her campaign, the Minnesota senator turned around and endorsed Joe Biden. Pete Buttigieg and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas did the same, handing Biden a trio of strong endorsements that could give him a big boost heading into today's contests. However, some see the sudden surge of support around Biden as an attempt by Democrats to mount a challenge against Bernie Sanders, whose support and momentum have made him a front-runner in the race. 2. Coronavirus  There are at least 100 cases of the coronavirus in the US now, including an outbreak at a nursing home in Seattle. The facility has 108 residents and another 180 staff members. At least 50 of them have shown signs of possible infection, and so far, four people with ties to the nursing home have died. The outbreak is an urgent reminder that America's elder care facilities are at a particular risk for coronavirus infections because of the dual threat of age and close living conditions. More than 90,000 people have been infected globally, prompting the World Health Organization to say the virus has brought the world into ""uncharted territory."" 3. Affordable Care Act  The Supreme Court announced it will decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, after lower court rulings found the law's individual mandate unconstitutional. The high court's ruling could uphold or alter the law, or eradicate it altogether, greatly changing the already controversial conversation around health care in the US. The proceedings will be a major political lightning rod, and mercifully, the issue won't be taken up until next term, presumably after the presidential election. This all comes as a bit of a surprise, since the Supreme Court previously indicated it was content to let the issue play out in lower courts before stepping in. However, that could take years, so this is the more expeditious option.  4. Israel Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is poised to win yesterday's general election, but that doesn't mean the country's political deadlock is over. If vote projections stand, Netanyahu's Likud Party will still need to find partners to form a coalition government. And it appears from some projections that even the party's closest allies won't be able to fill enough of those seats, which means Netanyahu will need to recruit stranger bedfellows to secure a ruling majority. Almost all of the votes should be in by tomorrow, and this weekend, all party leaders who have achieved representation in parliament will consult with Israel's President over who should get first shot at building a coalition. 5. Apple If you ever suspected your older model iPhone got markedly slower as newer models rolled out, the latest news from a lawsuit against the tech company will surely give you some vindication. Apple will pay up to half a billion dollars to settle a class action lawsuit alleging it used software updates to slow down older phones. The proposed settlement agreement requires Apple to pay the owners of certain iPhone models $25 per affected device. The two-year-long lawsuit has inspired global backlash, with some suggesting Apple intentionally diminished their devices' performance to force users to upgrade. Apple says it was just trying to address issues with older lithium-ion batteries. iPhone users in the US can file settlement claims if they owned an iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus or SE device bought before December 21, 2017.

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.  (CNN)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned Americans to plan for the inevitable spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) across the country. If we are going to mount an adequate response to a potential pandemic, our preparation must include an acknowledgment of the fractured state of health care access in this country. We need comprehensive coverage -- even if temporary -- to address the threat of Covid-19.  Without a comprehensive solution, the story of Osmel Martinez Azcue will be the first of what promises to be many more in the wake of Covid-19. The Miami Herald reported that Azcue was charged over $3,000 for being responsible and visiting the hospital to be screened for the novel coronavirus following a feverish return from China, the virus' epicenter. He is responsible for paying the hospital at least $1,400 of the bill and it may be more pending meeting his insurance company's strict requirements. Worries that they will confront bills like his will deter many from seeking appropriate care and put more people at risk.  Azcue has become the new face of an old and long-standing crisis in America: We lack universal health coverage. Too many Americans are either underinsured or completely uninsured In the global spread of Covid-19, this will prove catastrophic. Today, there are 27 million uninsured Americans -- almost 10% of our population. And like Azcue, 45% of Americans are underinsured, with coverage that results in catastrophically high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses they can't meet. Further, the adult uninsured rate rose to a four year high in the fourth quarter of 2018. It stood at 13.7% due to a number of factors, one of which is the Trump administration's efforts to undermine Obamacare and the public health safety net.   Systematic cuts by this administration and the Republicans in Congress have reduced the number of US citizens insured, undermined disease prevention and weakened vaccination efforts, to name a few. In 2017, Congress repealed the insurance mandate and stopped reimbursing insurers for low-income deductible and copay waivers. Insurance became less affordable and increased those who could opt out. In 2018, the Trump administration doubled down, lengthening the time short-term insurance could be offered from the previously allowed three months to a year and flooding the market with ""cheaper"" alternatives; these plans limit coverage such as for incidences of cancer only or have strict requirements before coverage kicks in like the plan Azcue has.  According to the Miami Herald, he pays $180 per month but is required to provide three years of medical records before his emergency room coverage would bring his bill down to a still sizable $1,400. Consumers seeking better deals are left vulnerable. When our citizens are sick, this administration's actions endanger Americans' health and wallets, and it undermines access and coverage that is essential for surveillance, detection and early response in the face of an outbreak -- like Covid-19.   Unfortunately, the worst is not over. President Trump falsely assured the American public that we have taken all preparations necessary, but in his recently proposed budget he called for another $844 billion in cuts over the next decade primarily from Medicaid, including the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) Medicaid expansion to low-income adults and other aspects of the ACA. This recent proposal, combined with historic cuts to the CDC, Department of Homeland Security and National Security Council, would further weaken our health system at a time when we should be fully prepared.  While Congress and the administration debate the size of an emergency funding package, ensuring comprehensive access to screening and care should be at the heart of any discussion. In the US, we have been struggling with testing capacity and lack a central count of how many people have been asked to self-quarantine or are being monitored by health professionals across the country.  Contrast this with other countries like the UK which have tested thousands and been proactive about identifying the full scope of their outbreak. On Sunday, data out of Washington state reinforced that we have been too conservative; genetic mapping of the virus in the community indicate that the Covid-19 has likely been circulating for weeks. Incontrovertibly, we will need to broaden the criteria by which we test immediately. If the US government wants to demonstrate its strength, it should show its commitment to protect its people in the face of threat. We need to provide leadership -- and head-on investment in our health system so that it can protect and care for Americans. We need to broaden the available coverage, public health interventions and access to care. There are options.   We should engage in multilingual, multilevel community health education efforts that target all communities and backgrounds in America. In a strong example of the power of ""reverse innovation,"" Ebola in West Africa taught us powerful lessons about how to create culture change around disease prevention and to reach all communities. When imams launched an awareness campaign and spoke about the importance of changing the cultural burial practices for Muslim victims, their authority and trust helped stem the rise of new infection. We have a diverse population, all at risk in one way or another. We should be thoughtful about how we reach communities that are vulnerable and our avenues of messaging about the virus. Far more difficult, but also critical, will be creating safe havens for undocumented immigrants to seek care. Given this administration's vehement attacks on immigrants, such an approach feels unfathomable. Ensuring access for all in our borders -- however temporary in the face of a public health crisis -- is the only option to containment in the United States. Removing financial barriers or subsequent punishment for those seeking screening or care will be essential to encouraging engagement with formal public health and health delivery systems, which must be on the front lines of containing Covid-19.  The discussion for a universal health care plan is front and center in the 2020 election. Beyond Covid-19, we need to pursue a better path to universal health coverage. The road for the required fix is long and there has not been the political will or leverage from any side to close the gap once and for all. In the face of Covid-19, we don't have the luxury of political fighting. We need the political sophistication, humility and courage to ensure care for all.  Covid-19 presents a serious threat to our security and well-being. We would be well-served to build a comprehensive system to address this particular threat, which can hopefully provide a springboard for a better system overall.  "

The 2020 edition of Google I/O, an annual developer conference originally scheduled for May 12-14 at Google's Mountainview headquarters, will no longer take place, the company confirmed on Tuesday.  ""Due to concerns around the coronavirus (COVID-19), and in accordance with health guidance from the CDC, WHO, and other health authorities, we have decided to cancel the physical Google I/O event,"" a company spokesperson told CNN Business. Google is currently weighing other options to engage with its developer audience. People who have already purchased tickets for the conference will receive a full refund by March 13 and will not have to re-register to buy a ticket for I/O 2021, Google (GOOGL) said on the conference website.  The annual developer event is the latest in a rapidly growing list of tech events that have been shelved because of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 3,100 people around the world, including nine in the United States.  Facebook canceled two conferences in recent weeks, including its big annual event, F8, weeks after the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona was also canceled. Companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) have said the virus could result in a hit to their sales.  "

It's still not clear how the virus spread to the Life Care Center in Kirkland, where more than 50 residents and staff have been experiencing symptoms and will be tested for coronavirus, King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin said. Some 180 people work there. A patient was taken Monday night by ambulance from the facility to a hospital, a first responder with knowledge of the situation said, adding that all emergency calls to the facility are being treated as coronavirus. Life Care Center officials did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment about the patient.  Meantime, 27 firefighters and two police officers in Kirkland are in quarantine, city spokeswoman Kellie Stickney said.  ""We have also been notified that some of our firefighters in quarantine are demonstrating flu like symptoms,"" the city said in a news release. One firefighter was released Monday. As a precaution, emergency medical technicians will now wear protective clothing every time they respond to a report of a sick person, even if that person does not mention coronavirus symptoms, Stickney said. Eighteen cases of novel coronavirus have been confirmed in Washington state, and six people -- including the four from Life Care Center -- have died. Those who perished ranged in age from their 40s to their 80s, and at least three had underlying health conditions. A motel will serve as a public isolation site An investigation into Life Care Center was launched after a resident and a health care worker tested positive for coronavirus, Duchin said.  ""Unfortunately, we are now starting to find more cases in Washington state that appear to have been acquired locally, and we know the virus is spreading in some communities,"" Dr. John Wiesman, the state's secretary of health, said. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee said the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent 20 people to help out with the investigation.  Life Care Center officials are monitoring residents and workers closely, Executive Director Ellie Basham said in a statement. Life Care manages or operates more than 200 facilities in 28 states. The company, based in Cleveland, Tennessee, was founded in 1970. ""Any resident displaying these symptoms is placed in isolation. Associates are screened prior to beginning work and upon leaving,"" Basham said. The disease is hardest on older people and people who are medically fragile, like those who have chronic medical issues, Dr.  Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC's national immunization and respiratory diseases center, said Saturday. King County will buy a motel and put recovering patients in isolation there, the county said in a news release.  A technical college in the area will close Tuesday for a second day to clean and disinfect the campus after 16 nursing students and a teacher visited Life Care Center a few days ago. The first case of coronavirus reported in the United States was a man from nearby Snohomish County.  He arrived from Wuhan, China -- the hub of the global outbreak -- at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport on January 15, before any health screenings for the virus began at US airports. The man sought medical care on January 19 after four days of self-quarantine at home, Washington officials said.

Swapping kisses for elbow bumps. The bizarre ways that coronavirus is changing etiquette,2020-03-04,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/world/coronavirus-etiquette-intl-scli/index.html,"['https://cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://cnn.com/2020/03/01/europe/italy-coronavirus-cases-travel-advisory/index.html', 'https://cnn.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-pandemic-frieden/index.html']"," (CNN)On Monday, a German politician did what could have been seen as the ultimate faux paus -- he rejected a handshake from his head of state, Chancellor Angela Merkel.  But rather than reprimanding him, Merkel smiled and praised German interior minister Horst Seehofer for his approach, which is growing more common as the coronavirus continues its global spread.  As authorities around the world scramble to contain the novel coronavirus, which has sickened more than 90,000 people and spread to more than 70 countries and territories, people have been facing a dilemma: How should I greet someone? No kissing, even if you're French On Saturday, a French official advised against a long-time French tradition of ""la bise"" -- the tradition of planting a kiss on a person's cheek multiple times -- over coronavirus fears.  ""Reduction of physical social contact is recommended. This includes la bise,"" French health minister Olivier Véran told reporters, adding that people should also avoid handshakes.  Officials in Australia have issued similar guidance, with New South Wales' health minister Brad Hazzard suggesting that Australian's ""exercise a degree of care and caution with who you decide to kiss,"" encouraging people to give each other a pat on the back instead of a handshake.  Authorities in Italy, which is facing the largest outbreak in Europe, have stopped short of outright advising against physical contact, but have admitted that reducing contact might come as a challenge.  ""We have a collective social life that is very florid, very expansive. We have lots of contact, we shake hands, we kiss each other, we hug each other,"" Italy's special commissioner for coronavirus Angelo Borrelli told reporters last month.  ""Maybe it is better in this period not to shake hands, and do not have too much contact, and try to be a bit less expansive, which is different from how I am,"" Borrelli added. So what's the alternative? With concerned citizens steering clear of handshakes, people around the world are getting creative with their meet and greets.  Dr. Sylvie Briand, the World Health Organization's director of pandemics, has endorsed a range of greetings as an alternative to the handshake, including bumping elbows, waving and bowing with palms together in the Thai ""wai."" On Tuesday, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts posted a video of himself on Twitter, bumping elbows with people leaving quarantine at the University of Nebraska's National Quarantine Unit in Omaha. Meanwhile, videos have surfaced from Iran and Lebanon of friends tapping their feet to greet one another.  Etiquette coach William Hanson told CNN that greeting people in a ""warm effusive style"" would come across as polite in the absence of a handshake.  People should use an ""open palmed gesture rather than a closed palm gesture... especially if you're greeting lots of people at a networking event or conference,"" Hanson said, adding that making eye contact should also be a priority.  ""Let's stop shaking hands for a while. I prefer the traditional Southeast Asian hands-together namaste greeting, although the elbow bump is fun,"" Dr. Tom Freidan, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), wrote.  But experts agree -- it isn't always possible to avoid physical contact with everyone you meet.  ""We are quite polite people generally, aren't we -- we don't want to say that I'm not shaking your hands because it implies that they might be dirty,"" Dr. Lisa Ackerley, adviser to the UK's Royal Society for Public Health, told CNN.  Ackerley said that people should try not to panic about the spread of the virus, but where possible they should reduce physical contact with others, including shaking hands and kissing on the cheek.  ""If you feel that that would be far too rude, then you just wash your hands afterwards or use a sanitizing gel -- obviously, discreetly,"" she said.  How do we stop the spread of the virus? When it comes to human-to-human transmission of viruses, often it happens when someone comes into contact with an infected person's secretions, such as droplets in a cough. Depending on how virulent the virus is, a cough, sneeze or handshake could cause exposure. The virus can also be transmitted by touching something an infected person has touched and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes.  Caregivers can sometimes be exposed by handling a patient's waste, according to the CDC. ""If we wash our hands frequently we should reduce the amount of coronavirus or any other organisms on our hands,"" Ackerley told CNN.  ""But it's also the point of when we wash our hands. When we arrive at a public building, when we arrive at a meeting room or conference or school, university and home, or just normal workplace, that's the point when we should be washing our hands to actually remove anything we've picked up on our journey.  ""And then by having good hand washing at that point, we're closing down some of the routes of transition from one person to another,"" she said, adding that we should also try to avoid touching our faces.

That total includes nine people who have died and others who have gotten sick at a nursing care facility in Kirkland. It is unclear whether it includes a person who works for Amazon in a downtown office building. According to a company email for staff members in Seattle and Bellevue,  the employee infected with the novel coronavirus became ill February 25 and has not been to work since then.   The company said it notified coworkers who had been in close contact with the patient.  The worker was based at an office building the company refers to as Amazon Brazil, according to the email. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed the email's authenticity to CNN, adding ""We're supporting the affected employee.""   The state has had at least 27 confirmed cases of Covid-19, seven of which were King County cases announced Tuesday.  Eight of those who died were from King County, and one was from Snohomish County, county officials said. At least six of the patients died at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, where some federal health experts are being sent. Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary of preparedness and response for the US Department of Health and Human Services, described to a US Senate committee the type of experts he was hoping to send across the country.  ""We're looking to employ and deploy some of our national disaster medical system personnel as well as other federal health care personnel to assist at the Evergreen long-term treatment facility,"" he said.  At the nursing home, a Life Care Center in Kirkland, which county officials say was home to at least nine of the patients who came down with coronavirus, more than 50 residents and staff members were experiencing symptoms and were tested for the virus, King County health officer Jeffrey Duchin said Monday. ""Current residents and associates continue to be monitored closely, specifically for an elevated temperature, cough and/or shortness of breath,""  Executive Director Ellie Basham said in a statement on the Life Care website. ""Any resident displaying these symptoms is placed in isolation. Associates are screened prior to beginning work and upon leaving."" A North Carolina resident who visited the facility and returned to the Raleigh area is now in isolation at home after a test indicated the person has coronavirus. The CDC should confirm the result in the next few days, officials said. A US Department of Homeland Security facility in King County was shut down Tuesday after officials learned an employee had visited a relative at Life Care, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf said during a House hearing.  The situation has residents frightened, US Sen. Patty Murray said during the Senate hearing, expressing concerns about testing protocol and the length of time it takes to get results.  ""I'm hearing from people who are sick, who want to get tested, (who) are not being told where to go,"" she said. ""I'm hearing that even when people do get tested -- and it's very few so far -- that results are taking way longer to get back to them.""  Feds ramp up testing As many as 1 million tests for coronavirus could be administered by the end of week, the FDA said, as cases across the United States rose to more than 100 and health officials warned the number will keep climbing. More than 120 cases of the virus have now been reported in 13 states -- with many of the patients in California and Washington. Cases have also been detected in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Wisconsin. About a quarter of the current cases were likely transmitted through US communities, officials have said, meaning they were not travel-related. ""My concern is as the next week or two or three go by, we're going to see a lot more community-related cases,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a news conference Monday. ""That's of great concern."" The number of cases has been on the rise as new guidelines from health officials gave more labs the go-ahead to conduct tests. Faulty kits from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially led to delayed and inconclusive results.   Over the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration further expanded who could test for the virus by allowing additional labs to develop their own tests for the virus. The move, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said, would enable academic centers and private companies to develop and use tests.  ""We believe this policy strikes the right balance during this public health emergency,"" Hahn said in a statement. ""We will continue to help to ensure sound science prior to clinical testing and follow-up with the critical independent review from the FDA, while quickly expanding testing capabilities in the U.S."" With more labs testing for the virus, the CDC stopped publishing the number of patients tested in the country -- a figure it had kept track of on its website.  ""Now that states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC's numbers may not represent all of the testing being done nationwide,"" the agency said in a Tuesday email. Cases climb, officials say risk still low Meanwhile, state and health officials maintain there is no need to panic.  ""We've seen an increase of cases in the United States over the weekend,"" Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Monday. ""I want folks to understand that we knew this was coming, we told folks that this was going to happen and it is why we've been preaching preparedness from the very start."" He added, ""Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not."" Of the 124 cases, at least 45 are repatriated residents from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which docked in Japan last month after an outbreak. More than 120 evacuees from the ship saw their scheduled Monday release from quarantine at Texas' Lackland Air Force Base delayed until Tuesday.  Those who have shown no symptoms of coronavirus will be released Tuesday ""in an orderly way to minimize potential exposure to the San Antonio community,"" local health officials said.   Eleven in Santa Clara County, California Twenty-five cases of the virus have been reported in California, including the first one in the city of Berkeley. The resident, who returned to the city February 23, was concerned about being exposed through travel and stayed home in a self-imposed quarantine, according to a news release from the city. Orange County has two people whose positive tests need to be confirmed by the CDC. They are a woman in her 30s and a man in his 60s. They traveled to countries with widespread transmission, the Orange County Health Care Agency said. ""The more you look for something, the more likely you are to find it,"" said Dr. Nichole Quick, county health officer. ""Now that our Public Health Laboratory is able to perform COVID-19 testing, we expect to see more cases here in Orange County."" In Northern California, two more cases were confirmed Monday, according to Santa Clara County Public Health Department, bringing the county's total to 11.

Pressure has been mounting on Iranian officials to take action against the virus as the death toll and number of cases rapidly shoots up. Iran has reported 92 deaths, as 586 new infections were reported overnight, bringing the total up to 2,922, state media reported. The country has also come under pressure as Middle Eastern nations, including Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, have reported cases with links to the Iranian city of Qom, where several holy sites are regularly visited by large crowds. After weeks of refusing to restrict visits to the sites, the government on Wednesday said that those trying to leave the city would be quarantined if they showed symptoms of the virus, including a fever. Medical teams will begin taking temperatures of those trying to leave, according to Qom University of Medical Science's Deputy Dean Ali Abrazi. He also said the university was building a field hospital to tackle the outbreak, according to state media. Iranian officials initially reassured its nationals that the virus would be contained, but it was difficult to convince Iranians that was the case as 23 members of parliament tested positive for the virus and an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei died on Monday. Iran's First Vice President Eshaq Jahanghiri issued an order to government ministries, with the exception of the foreign ministry, suspending travel to international conferences and gatherings until further notice, state media reports. Questions had swirled over whether the government was being transparent in reporting case numbers, as the high death toll reported several days ago suggested infection numbers should have been much higher than officials had confirmed. Health system under stress Iranian Deputy Health Minister Ali Reza Reisy announced Tuesday that a nationwide team of 300,000 health workers and specialists would be deployed to prop up the country's healthcare system.   There are growing concerns that Iran's health services are ill-equipped to respond effectively to the growing number of cases. Although the system has improved in recent decades, crippling sanctions have hampered its development.  Doctors in the country had told CNN before the outbreak that Iran was struggling to keep up with soaring prices of medications and medical instruments because of sanctions. International organizations are now looking at how to fill the gaps in the system. The World Health Organization sent a team to Iran on Monday as well as its first planeload of assistance. ""The plane carrying the technical team members also contained a shipment of medical supplies and protective equipment to support over 15,000 health care workers, as well as enough laboratory kits enough to test and diagnose nearly 100,000 people,"" the WHO said in a statement.  Iran said the WHO supplied eight tons of medicines and test kits via a UAE military aircraft from Dubai as well as six teams of epidemiologists, physicians and laboratory tests specialists, state-run IRNA reported. Britons stuck in Iranian jails Iran's Judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said the health ministry would oversee the release of prisoners, semi-official news agency ISNA reported. He did not elaborate on where they would be kept or how authorities would keep track of them,   ""The health of the prisoners is very important for us regardless of their status as security prisoners or regular prisoners,"" Esmaili said. It was also unclear whether Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian mother jailed in Iran on espionage charges, would be among those released. Zaghari-Ratcliffe believes she has contracted coronavirus in Evin prison outside Tehran, according to a family statement released Saturday. On Tuesday, Iran's ambassador to the United Kingdom Hamid Baeidinejad tweeted that Zaghari-Radcliffe did not have coronavirus, amid calls for her to be tested.  He added that she may be granted a furlough on Wednesday or Thursday to join family in Tehran. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe told CNN her release had not yet happened. The UK's foreign office said in a statement: ""We're following up the Iranian ambassador's comments on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and are urgently seeking clarification from the Iranian Government on her situation."" It also called for information from Iran on reports that the virus was spreading in Evin prison and to ""immediately allow health professionals into Evin prison to assess the situation of British-Iranian dual nationals there.""  People in Iran are among those in many countries panic-buying goods in case the outbreak worsens. The country is facing a shortage of hand sanitizers, as demand for the products soar.

The measure will next need to be taken up by the Senate. The White House is expected to back the deal.  LIVE UPDATES: Coronavirus outbreak spreads across the world The agreement provides $7.8 billion in appropriations to address the outbreak of coronavirus as well as an additional $500 million to fund a telehealth program in an effort to help expand access to health services for seniors. The legislation was formally unveiled on Wednesday afternoon with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer promising a vote later in the day.   Lawmakers have been meeting for days to hammer out a package to respond to the coronavirus outbreak. The total funding package of $8.3 billion is an amount far higher than the $2.5 billion White House request. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer proposed $8.5 billion to deal with the outbreak last week. The emergency funding package will include over $3 billion to help fund research and development for vaccines as well as diagnostic tests and therapeutic responses to coronavirus.  It will also include $2.2 billion to be used for efforts related to prevention, preparedness and response to the spread of coronavirus, of which $950 million will go to supporting state and local health agencies.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement on Wednesday that the House would ""move swiftly to pass this vital coronavirus emergency response package.""   Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated on Wednesday that the aim is to pass the emergency funding bill this week.  ""Our goal would be to do it this week, if we get cooperation,"" McConnell said, shortly after a broad agreement was reached. GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said he anticipates some budget-conscious Republicans will vote against the package because of its large price tag, but he didn't indicate who might oppose it. ""Not everyone will vote for the bill.  But they would not have voted for it at $2.2 billion either,"" Blunt said, referring to the much smaller original supplemental request from the White House. GOP Whip John Thune said if some members push for procedural votes because they have concerns with the bill, it could slow things down. But the South Dakota Republican was hopeful the Senate would pass it ""fairly quickly."" Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby of Alabama, who directed talks for Senate Republicans, was more hopeful. He repeatedly predicted the bill would pass Thursday.

Even as officials insist their outlook for the economy is good -- and that coronavirus will not present a serious threat -- there have been continuing discussions of ways to protect against a slowdown. Ideas being batted about inside the White House include finding a way for government to guarantee paid sick leave for workers or sending money to small businesses to avoid layoffs, people familiar with the early discussions said, cautioning the brainstorming was still loose and in its early phases. After a rate cut by the Federal Reserve did little to calm markets, administration officials have appeared resistant to temporary fiscal steps such as a payroll tax cut, even as Trump publicly floats the idea.  Some economists and business leaders have said fiscal policy steps will be necessary on top of central bank action. But underlying concerns about supply chain interruptions and continued questions about the administration's response to coronavirus -- such as problems with testing -- aren't likely to be solved by either fiscal or monetary policy. Though the administration says it's not currently under consideration, the idea of a payroll tax holiday hasn't been entirely ruled out, officials said, suggesting the full scope of the economic fallout needs to be ascertained before the President proposes steps to Congress. ""I'm focused on this. The country is in great shape. The market is in great shape. I'm focused on this. This is very important,"" Trump said when questioned about another triple-digit loss in the Dow Industrial Average on Tuesday afternoon. He said he believed it would be a good time for middle-income tax cuts ""if the Democrats would approve it."" Even as Trump publicly downplays the volatile markets, and insists he remains focused on the health impact of the outbreak, he has tasked advisers with devising ways to protect the economy from lasting damage.  A White House official said the talks have included the possibility of including money for the Small Business Administration in a sweeping spending package that's working its way through Congress now. Officials also said there have been discussions about increasing unemployment benefits for people who might lose their jobs because of an economic slowdown and ensuring Americans have adequate sick leave so don't feel obliged to come to work when they have potential symptoms of the disease. Health authorities have said it is essential for sick people -- or people who might have come into contact with the virus -- to stay home from work to avoid spreading the disease further. Many low-wage workers and workers in service industries do not get paid if they take time off when sick. The ideas being discussed among Trump's advisers remain in the early stages and Trump himself hasn't proposed new ideas to Congress meant to reinforce the economy. White House officials are skeptical that Democrats will go along with steps that would boost the economy before November's election. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, said during a hearing on Tuesday that temporary measures such as tax cuts should only come after stimulus measures that include new infrastructure funding, something Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin appeared to agree with. ""If there's a need to stimulate the economy as a result of the coronavirus, I am sure that infrastructure is a priority for the President,"" he said. In the same hearing, Mnuchin said the White House was not considering suspending tariffs on Chinese or European goods, which have been a factor in global economic unease over the past year. Trump has publicly goaded the Federal Reserve to further cut interest rates, even though a half-point cut on Tuesday did little to stabilize markets. On Twitter he called for ""more easing and cutting"" following the emergency rate cut. CNN's Sarah Westwood, Jim Acosta and John Harwood contributed to this report."

The release of the 25th film in the lucrative Bond series was scheduled to hit theaters in North America on April 10th, but MGM and Universal announced on Wednesday that the film would be delayed. ""After careful consideration and thorough evaluation of the global theatrical marketplace, the release of 'No Time To Die' will be postponed until November 2020,"" the film's official Twitter account said on Wednesday.  It will now hit US theaters on November 25. The film will be released in the UK on November 12.The coronavirus outbreak, which has caused more than 3,000 deaths globally, the majority in Asia, has forced the closure of theaters in Italy, Korea and China. China is the second biggest movie market in the world behind the U.S. ""Like every other global company, we're looking at the marketplace and we're trying to understand where the markets are down,"" an MGM spokesperson told CNN Business. ""A huge percentage of theaters around the world are unavailable for this film."" The spokesperson said that it ""didn't seem achievable for the film to hit its high level of success"" in this marketplace. ""It was really an economic decision more than anything else,"" the spokesperson added.  ""No Time To Die,"" which was set to be one of Hollywood's biggest blockbusters of the spring, is the first major film to shift its opening due to the coronavirus. ""This is a huge deal,"" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. ""James Bond is one of cinema's highest profile franchises. It's brought in nearly $5 billion worldwide over 24 films and is beloved around the world. To move it with weeks to go until its release is unprecedented."" Dergarabedian added that more studios might consider ""shifting the schedules of their global blockbusters in this way to ensure the best possible outcome for their films going forward."" "
US Navy to self-quarantine ships in Europe due to coronavirus,2020-03-04,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/politics/navy-coronavirus-self-quarantine-ships-europe/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/navy-coronavirus-pacific-self-quarantine/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-03-20-intl-hnk/index.html', 'https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/27/politics/us-south-korea-military-drill-coronavirus/index.html']"," (CNN)The US Navy's 6th Fleet is instituting a 14-day self-quarantine between port visits by US Navy ships in Europe over concerns of the coronavirus, according to two US Navy officials, a move intended to bring the fleet inline with instructions from the US Pacific Fleet.  Ships will stay at sea for at least 14 days after visiting any port in Europe in order to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. A spokesman for the 6th Fleet confirmed the self-quarantine to CNN when asked.  ""In conjunction with the other fleets, we have instituted a 14-day underway period between port visits to allow for crew monitoring,"" said Commander Kyle Raines, spokesman for the 6th Fleet. The 6th Fleet is responsible for the US Navy presence in Europe, as well as Russia and almost all of Africa.  The precautionary move to keep its ship in the region at sea for two weeks has not impacted the Navy's ability to perform its missions there. The US aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower conducted an inter-operability exercise with the French aircraft carrier the FS Charles de Gaulle in the Mediterranean Sea Tuesday, an exercise that involved US and French military jets landing on each other's vessels. Similarly the guided-missile destroyer USS Ross was able to help rescue mariners from a Turkish vessel in the Sea of Marmara Tuesday after the civilian ship caught fire. The self-quarantine for 6th Fleet is only the latest step the Pentagon has taken to protect its service members from the virus, which has spread globally to 43 countries outside of China and affected US military operations in Asia, the Middle East and Europe.  An upcoming military exercise with South Korea was suspended due to concerns about the virus. And, last week, the US military's Indo-Pacific Command, which oversees all US troops in the region, restricted all non-essential travel to South Korea for all US service members, contractors and defense department civilians serving as part of the command. US Central Command, which oversees US forces in the Middle East, has also imposed restrictions on the movement of US troops there. On US military bases in Italy, access to on-base schools, child-care facilities, gyms and other public buildings has been temporarily halted and troops are bracing for the possibility of similar restrictions on other bases in Europe. ""The overall broad impact to the uniformed U.S. military is very, very minimal. It's not to say it's zero, but it's very, very minimal,"" Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon Monday. ""Commanders are taking all necessary precautions because this is unique to every situation and every location. So we've sent out, as I said, memorandums and directives. The commanders have the information they need, and we're relying on them to make good judgments,"" Milley added. This story has been updated to reflect additional background information. "

""It's important for us to remember at this stage that we're actively evaluating mass gatherings on a daily basis,"" said Mark Escott, the interim medical director and health authority for Austin Public Health. ""Right now there's no evidence that closing South by Southwest or other activities is going to make this community safer. We're constantly monitoring that situation."" The organizers behind SXSW, which is scheduled to take place from March 13 to March 22, had come under public pressure in recent days to cancel the event. Several high-profile attendees had also dropped out, citing concerns about the virus.  Twitter was the first big company to pull out of the event, citing its new policy restricting all business travel because of the virus. Facebook (FB), Intel (INTC), Vevo and Mashable soon followed suit.  Popular video app TikTok also backed out, saying it would explore ""alternative ways"" to bring its planned SXSW content to audiences. ""While we think the risk is relatively low, we are erring on the side of caution,"" a TikTok spokesperson told CNN Business on Tuesday. Despite the cancellations, SXSW organizers announced new keynote speakers this week, including Hillary Clinton and Andrew Yang. The conference organizers said on Monday they would be ""proceeding as planned"" and that they were working with local, state and federal agencies to ensure a safe event.  SXSW draws thousands of people to Austin each year and generates millions of dollars for the city. The economic impact of last year's event on the city was estimated to be $355.9 million, according to a report paid for by SXSW.  But calls to cancel the conference have continued to grow, with a petition on Change.org urging SXSW to do so getting more than 43,000 signatures.  Austin mayor Steve Adler stressed during the press conference that the city is not being pressured by SXSW to keep the event running.  ""I want the community to know that these decisions are being made by our medical professionals, and that no corporation, or South By, or anybody else has a seat at that table. Because we're only motivated by making sure that we do what we can to keep the community safe,"" Adler said.  Escott suggested during the press conference that keeping SXSW as an organized event could be better for the community.  ""If we make the recommendation to shut down SXSW, people will still come here, without that organizational structure that SXSW provides,"" Escott said. ""All along SXSW has been extremely responsive."" Sarah Eckhardt, the judge of Travis County, which includes Austin, said at the press conference that the community should follow healthy practices such as hand washing.  ""I would ask the community — and strongly suggest — that panic will weaken us. So let's do what our mothers taught us: let's cover our sneezes, let's wash our hands, and let's be good neighbors,"" Eckhardt said. ""Keep calm and carry on, y'all, and remember what your momma taught ya."" The coronavirus, which has killed 3,200 people worldwide, has forced numerous businesses and organizers to rethink public events. One of global technology's biggest events, the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, was canceled in February, as was the Geneva Motor Show.  Facebook also canceled an advertising conference and F8, its biggest event of the year, and several companies have imposed travel restrictions on their employees. Google canceled its big annual developer conference on Tuesday.  Since SXSW has yet to be canceled, attending companies are continuing to prepare for their scheduled events.  ""Patreon is still attending SXSW. We will have hand sanitizer stations throughout the house and giving it away as branded swag. We have a professional cleaning crew coming 2x day to the in house,"" a Patreon spokesperson told CNN Business. Fast Company and Inc., two publications owned by Mansueto Ventures, will still host their houses called Fast Company Grill and Inc. Founders House.  ""Our employees' safety is paramount here at Inc. and Fast Company. Regarding SXSW, we are getting our guidance from the CDC and Austin Public Health,"" said Eric Schurenberg, CEO of Mansueto Ventures. ""So far both authorities have said that it's safe to travel to Austin and to host events at SXSW as scheduled. If that changes, we'll change our plans accordingly."" WarnerMedia, which owns CNN, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has been planning a house with events at SXSW for several of its brands.  "

The virus has infected more than 92,800 people and killed at least 3,200 since it was first identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year. It has now spread to more than 75 countries and territories, with self-sustaining clusters forming in South Korea, Japan, parts of Europe, Iran and the United States.  At a news briefing Tuesday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that each month, the organization estimates that about 89 million medical masks, 76 million examination gloves and 1.6 million goggles will be required globally for health care workers to respond to the outbreak.  ""Shortages are leaving doctors, nurses and other front line health care workers dangerously ill-equipped,"" said Ghebreyesus. ""The WHO has shipped nearly half a million sets of personal protective equipment to 27 countries, but supplies are rapidly depleting."" The dire warning comes as China announced a further drop in new cases, raising hopes that the outbreak is beginning to level off in the hard-hit country. Though the vast majority of the total number of confirmed cases and deaths are inside of China, the number of new daily infections outside of the country now exceeds those inside.  The Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said that 115 infections and 37 deaths related to the coronavirus were confirmed Tuesday in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the provincial capital. The rest of mainland China, excluding Hubei, saw only one death and four infections, the NHC reported, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases in the country to at least 2,981 deaths and 80,270 cases.  To date, nearly 50,000 patients have recovered and been discharged from hospital, the NHC reported. The WHO has said it is working with governments, manufacturers and the Pandemic Supply Chain Network to boost production and secure supplies for at-risk countries. However, it is predicted globally supplies will need to be increased by 40% to meet demand.  Infections in Iran, one of the most critically affected countries, have now surged to more than 2,300 cases -- which includes about 8% of the country's parliament -- and 77 deaths, including an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.  South Korea confirmed one new death and 516 more cases of the novel coronavirus Tuesday, bringing the national death toll to 32 and the total number of confirmed cases to 5,328, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). Among the 516 new cases, 405 are from the city of Daegu, where the outbreak has been concentrated.  And in Europe, authorities are taking early precautions to stop potential spreading. Several governments are preventing large gatherings of people in order to curb community transmission, and closing public spaces like the Louvre in Paris and Milan's La Scala opera house.  In Italy, at least 79 people have been killed by the virus and  more than 2,500 have been infected. Most of the cases have been reported in the country's north. Market concerns The coronavirus and its knock-on effects have rattled markets worldwide, with investors concerned that measures aimed to stop the virus' spread could stop business from functioning as normal. The World Bank pledged to give $12 billion to more than 60 countries affected by the virus, while the United States and Europe are also taking steps to combat the virus' potential economic effects. The US Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point on Tuesday, a bold attempt to give the US economy a jolt in the face of concerns about the coronavirus outbreak. It was the first unscheduled, emergency rate cut since 2008. But although the fundamentals of the US economy remain strong, ""the coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" the central bank said in a statement. Finance officials from the G7 major economies issued a joint statement that committed them to using ""all appropriate policy tools to achieve strong, sustainable growth"" but stopped short of outlining specific steps. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development warned Monday that global economic growth could be cut in half this year if the outbreak continues to spread. It called for an immediate response to contain the outbreak, recommending that governments increase spending and central banks implement policies to help cushion the blow from the virus. Private companies are also preparing and moving ahead cautiously. Google canceled its annual developer's conference, the tech giant's biggest event of the year, and JPMorgan Chase asked thousands of its employees to work from home for a day to test its own contingency plans, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. US counts more than 100 cases The US has now identified at least 126 coronavirus cases, which include 45 Americans who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess Cruise ship in Japan and three from Wuhan, and another 78 detected and tested in the United States through the US public health systems. Those numbers include presumptive positive cases that tested positive in public health labs and are pending confirmation from the US Centers for Disease Control. Nine people have died of the virus in the US, all in the state of Washington. Many of the state's 27 reported infections are believed to be connected to a nursing home near Seattle. California is the next hardest hit state, with 27 cases and no deaths. Federal public health authorities have issued several calls for calm. US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said the government ""knew this was coming."" ""Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not,"" he said. Vice President Mike Pence has also advised Americans that the virus does not pose a major threat to them. ""Let's be clear: The risk to the American people of the coronavirus remains low, according to all of the experts that we are working with across the government,"" Pence said.

Sign up here.) 1. Election 2020 Some Super Tuesday results are still rolling in, but it's already clear Joe Biden was the day's biggest winner. The former Vice President swept the southern elections, turned in a surprise victory in Texas and even poached a victory in Elizabeth Warren's home state of Massachusetts. Biden's success in yesterday's contests shows his popularity among key demographics, like African Americans, older voters and white suburbanites. While as of this morning, Biden had secured a commanding majority of the delegates up for grabs across 14 states and one US territory, Bernie Sanders leads in California, one of the day's biggest prizes. If he wins there, it could put his delegate count over Biden's. Meanwhile, Warren and Michael Bloomberg are facing some harsh disappointments. Warren failed to win a single contest, and Bloomberg limped away with one: American Samoa.  2. Tennessee tornado Tennessee is under a state of emergency after its deadliest tornado day in seven years. At least 24 people were killed and dozens more are unaccounted for after storms ripped through the Nashville area. Thousands are still without power, and search and rescue teams are working to locate the missing. The destruction and confusion following the storms led some polling places in the state and surrounding areas to extend their hours to accommodate Super Tuesday voters. In recent years, scientists have noticed an increased frequency of tornadoes in the Southeast. In these areas, tornadoes tend to be harder to spot and often come at night, when people are less prepared.  3. Coronavirus  Economic fears over the coronavirus epidemic are starting to manifest into action. The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates by half a percentage point in an attempt to give the US economy a jolt. It's the first unscheduled, emergency rate cut since 2008. Experts are hoping this economic ""panic button"" will move leaders in the health sector and the White House to enact more serious policies to stop the virus' spread and secondary effects. Congressional negotiators still haven't finalized a spending bill to help battle the coronavirus, and its passage hinges on Democrats insisting any vaccine against the virus is made affordable for everyone. Worldwide cases have now surpassed 92,000, with dozens of new cases being reported in the US and Australia. Meantime, Iran will temporarily release 54,000 people from prisons as officials struggle to contain the rapid spread of the biggest coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East. 4. Taliban The US has conducted an airstrike against Taliban fighters in Afghanistan as the historic deal between the two entities threatens to fray mere days after it was signed. The breakdown began after reports the Taliban had resumed violence in the country, carrying out 33 reported attacks that killed six civilians and wounded 14 others. Such aggression is expressly forbidden by the deal with the US, in exchange for the US reducing its troop presence in the country. President Trump and Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban's chief negotiator, spoke by phone amid the reports. Hours later, military officials announced the airstrike, which they said was a defensive move to protect a US military checkpoint.  5. Iran Iran has ramped up its production of nuclear materials and nearly tripled its stockpile of low enriched uranium since November, according to the UN's nuclear watchdog. The purpose of such an increase is a bit tricky: Low enriched uranium is used for nuclear power plants, not weapons. However, in theory, the increased stockpiles reduce the time the country would need to acquire enough weapons-grade material to create a bomb. The increase also puts Iran's stores of low enriched uranium far over the limit set by the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which the US left in 2018.  BREAKFAST BROWSE A man brought a llama to his sister's wedding, and everyone loved it ... ... except for the sister.  Here's how to stay productive if coronavirus precautions require you to work from home  Unfortunately, you probably need to change out of your pj's.  An Australian thief used a fishing rod to steal a Versace necklace  As Bear Grylls says, ""Improvise.

First veteran coronavirus case confirmed by Trump's VA secretary,2020-03-04,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/wilkie-coronavirus-veteran-case-paulo-alto/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/us-coronavirus-update-wednesday/index.html', 'http://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/health/us-coronavirus-cases-state-by-state/index.html', 'https://www.blogs.va.gov/VAntage/72072/coronavirus-be-informed-and-call-your-provider-if-symptoms-develop/#_blank']","Washington (CNN)Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie confirmed during his testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday that one veteran is being treated for the coronavirus at a VA facility in Palo Alto, California, and said the agency has a section of the campus set up to receive veterans who have the virus. ""We began moving on supply chain and preparation really before this became a national issue. Case in point is the one veteran, that we know of, who has this virus. We prepared a swath, a section of our Palo Alto campus to receive veterans who have this virus. We set it up for that and that veteran is being taken care of there,"" Wilkie told lawmakers on the House Appropriations Committee. This is the first time coronavirus has directly touched the second largest federal agency, which provides care to veterans at 1,243 health care facilities across the country. After the hearing, Wilkie, who is part of the White House task force addressing the potential of a pandemic, stressed that while there is only one known coronavirus case involving a veteran, VA staff and facilities are well prepared to handle the outbreak should it continue to spread. ""We rehearse all the time, for epidemics and natural disasters — we are constantly rehearsing and just change the name on whatever we are dealing with ... if it's Ebola, if it's H1-N1, that's how we deal with it,"" he told CNN. Despite some complaints from local health officials in California about a lack of kits used to test for the virus, Wilkie told CNN Wednesday that he is not aware of any such reports coming from VA facilities.  ""We do all sorts of things, we have questionnaires, we take temperatures ... we are using our own resources,"" he said. Asked if any VA facilities have requested additional testing kits, Wilkie said: ""Not that I know of, because, again, we have one case so far.""    The VA has about 1,000 testing kits, Veterans Health Administration head Dr. Richard Stone told House lawmakers Wednesday, adding that the department plans to order more. Each kit is capable of testing hundreds of people.  Wilkie's comments come as health officials say the US should be proactive when it comes to testing for the novel coronavirus.   ""Yes. The answer is yes and I feel strongly about that,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told lawmakers Wednesday when asked if the US should be proactive with testing in hospitals, rather than waiting for people to come and be tested.  Negotiators in Congress also struck a deal Wednesday on a sweeping spending package to dedicate billions to dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, according to two sources involved with the talks. The White House is expected to back the deal, which is expected to be voted on by the House of Representatives later Wednesday.  Meanwhile, VA spokesperson Christina Mandreucci told CNN on Wednesday that the agency is coordinating with federal health officials to ensure veterans ""benefit from the latest prevention, testing and treatment protocols and develop emergency management plans for medical centers."" ""While the Department of Health and Human Services is leading the federal government's COVID-19 response efforts, VA is monitoring the situation through its Emergency Management Coordination Cell and collaborating with public health officials from HHS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure Veterans benefit from the latest prevention, testing and treatment protocols and develop emergency management plans for medical centers,"" Mandreucci added.

That kind of mingling might repel customers and workers as the coronavirus continues to spread. Businesses looking to control the situation need to tread carefully. Sick staff Managers should send home employees that come in with symptoms of a respiratory illness and separate them from other coworkers, public health experts have said. But bosses can't conduct ""medical examinations"" to confirm someone is ill, including taking their temperature, according to a recent note law firm Fox Rothschild sent to clients.  Employees could be entitled to their paychecks even if they are sent home before doing any work. Businesses must also protect the privacy of workers suspected or confirmed of having the coronavirus when informing the rest of the staff that they were potentially exposed. Companies should contact their local health department to create a plan before divulging the information to their staff, the law firm recommended. Hiring and firing In addition, businesses can't fire employees for having the coronavirus, and they can't ask job applicants about their medical conditions. This includes inquiring if they were previously infected or if they had traveled to any of the areas affected by the virus, such as China, Iran or Italy. ""The fact that there is great concern surrounding the coronavirus, or that other employees may not want to work with a particular person out of fear of contracting the coronavirus, is of no consequence,"" Fox Rothschild wrote. Masks Masks and respirators have become more common as people try to protect themselves from the virus, leading to shortages, even though health officials have said they're not necessary for the general population. Managers can stop employees -- particularly those like servers that deal directly with clients -- from wearing them, according to Fox Rothschild.  It's a tricky move, the firm wrote. But it's generally allowed unless the employee has a disability that requires a mask or works directly with someone who's infected.  Dealing with customers Patrons might also be curious about whether workers serving them are affected by the virus. The information can be disclosed as long as the business doesn't give away an employees' identity, according to the law firm.  In any case, it would ""likely be near impossible to establish that a guest contracted coronavirus from a retail operation that has guests, employees and other visitors to the workplace coming in and out all day,"" said lawyer Carolyn D. Richmond, the chair of Fox Rothschild's hospitality practice. How businesses are adapting More than 3,200 people have died from the novel coronavirus as of Wednesday, most of them in China, and 92,000 people worldwide were infected. The U.S. had reported 120 cases and nine deaths.  The outbreak led Dunkin (DNKN) to encourage franchise owners to tell employees not to come to work if they're ill as well as review their paid time off and sick leave policies, a spokesperson said. Dunkin' added that it is up to franchisees to enforce the measures.  Meanwhile, Burger King said it was emphasizing normal hygiene practices. Chick-fil-A declined to comment, while McDonald's, Wendy's, Starbucks and other food retailers didn't reply to inquiries. The recommendation to stay home might be difficult to follow because more than half of leisure and hospitality workers in the United States don't get paid sick leave. Employers should remind workers about any time off they might be entitled to, either for sick leave or to take care of relatives, according to Fox Rothschild. Companies such as Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) have canceled travel or conference appearances as the virus spreads, and JP Morgan (JPM) asked employees to work from home for a day to test its ability to cope. By and large businesses, remain open in the United States.  The immediate health risk was still low for most Americans as of Tuesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "

The new patient is from Wake County, home to Raleigh and 1.1 million people. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said the person was exposed at a center in Washington where there is a Covid-19 outbreak while on a trip. That facility is the Life Care Center in Kirkland, northeast of Seattle, where county and federal officials are trying to determine how the disease got there and watching many of the more than 200 people who lived or worked there for signs of coronavirus.  Four Life Care residents died at a hospital and one died at a residence, officials said Tuesday. The North Carolina resident's positive test has not been confirmed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. ""The person is doing well and is in isolation at home,"" Cooper said. ""I know people are worried about this virus, and I want to assure you that the state of North Carolina is prepared."" Health officials said they contact the person twice a day about the person's temperature and other health issues.  Health officials are tracing the person's travel from Washington, Dr. Mandy Cohen, the state's secretary of health and human services, said. The investigation is just beginning, she said.  Wake County public health officials said the person traveled through Raleigh-Durham International Airport on February 22. The passenger ""was not experiencing symptoms when they traveled through ... Based on CDC guidance, there was no identifiable risk from this case to other travelers,"" a state health department official said. Cooper said North Carolinians should take the same preventative measures as for the flu, which killed 24 people in the state last week. CNN's Jamiel Lynch contributed to this report. "
Baby Yoda toy production could be derailed by coronavirus,2020-03-04,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/business/coronavirus-baby-yoda/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/23/us/baby-yoda-memes-trnd/index.html', 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DIS&source=story_quote_link', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt4H_7ZCqZs', 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HAS&source=story_quote_link', 'https://investor.hasbro.com/node/31781/html', 'https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MAT&source=story_quote_link']","New York (CNN Business)Hasbro, the maker of several ""Star Wars"" Baby Yoda toys set to hit stores later this year, confirmed last week that its supply chain is being disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus disruptions haven't hurt production of Baby Yoda toys yet, according to industry expert Jim Silver, CEO of Toys, Tots, Pets & More, a toy industry review website. Silver said he spoke with sources inside the Chinese factories that Hasbro works with. But Silver said the situation could soon change for the worse -- and not just for Baby Yoda. ""If things aren't normal by the time June and July roll around, there will be shortages on a litany of toys,"" Silver told CNN Business. Baby Yoda, officially known as ""The Child,"" became an internet sensation in November following its surprise debut at the end of episode one of the Disney+ series ""The Mandalorian."" Disney (DIS) chose to forgo manufacturing Baby Yoda toys until after the character made its first appearance on the show. The Mandalorian's creators told reporters in November they feared making Baby Yoda toys available before its premiere would tip off fans to the adorable little alien's surprise introduction. Silver expects to see Baby Yoda toy production decline by 5% to 10% because of coronavirus, but said Hasbro is ""close to being able to ship what they originally projected."" Hasbro (HAS) confirmed it has been forced to contend with coronavirus delays in an email to CNN Business.  ""We are working to mitigate the impact of our manufacturing partner factories being closed longer than anticipated, as well as to reschedule the shipments we have not been able to make,"" Hasbro CFO Deborah Thomas told investors and analysts on February 21. In a regulatory filing released Thursday, Hasbro said that China's coronavirus quarantines and travel restrictions have temporarily prevented workers at its Chinese source factories from assembling toys. The company said the virus ""could have a significant negative impact on our revenues, profitability and business."" Silver said the most significant disruptions were to raw materials used to make the Hasbro toys. Most of the resin and plastics are almost exclusively available in China. ""There was difficulty in obtaining some of these raw materials or the same quantity they want to get,"" Silver said. Panjiva, the supply chain research unit of S&P Global Market Intelligence, sounded the alarm about Hasbro and Mattel (MAT) in a February 25 report. The firm said supply chains for both toy companies and the toy industry overall were ""significantly disrupted"" by China's response to the coronavirus. Mattel's factories in China were back in business on February 17. But S&P said some of the company's factory employees were prevented from returning to work, citing remarks made by Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz during a February 21 phone call with shareholders and analysts. In another investor call the same day, Hasbro officials said the company is ""working to mitigate the impact"" of coronavirus in the short term while moving part of its supply chain out of China in the long term. ""In the next couple of years [we] will be about 50% out of China,"" Hasbro Chief Operating Officer John Frascotti said. Disney and Hasbro unveiled several Baby Yoda toys in New York City on February 20. The ""Star Wars"" showcase's centerpiece was ""The Child Animatronic Edition,"" a $59.99 life-like version of Baby Yoda that moves and makes baby sounds just like the infant character. Pre-orders for the toy quickly sold out online. Baby Yoda toys from Hasbro, Funko, Mattel and Build-A-Bear are scheduled to hit stores some time this month, according to a February 20 announcement from Disney. June is the beginning of the toy industry's holiday season production cycle and a crucial deadline that toy manufacturers must meet if they hope to prevent coronavirus interruptions from disrupting their most critical sales season. ""It would affect production of Baby Yoda and just about every other toy that is made overseas,"" Silver said. "

Pence said in an off-camera briefing at the White House that there was new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that any American could be tested -- ""no restrictions, subject to doctors' orders."" The announcement follows numerous complaints of citizens asking to be tested and turned away due to the strict CDC testing criteria. Pence said the new guidance will make clear ""that any clinician or health authority can administer the test."" The change was announced after confusion over how quickly the US could ramp up testing for roughly 1 million people for coronavirus. After suggesting Monday that the US would be able to test close to 1 million people for coronavirus by the end of the week, the Trump administration has since clarified -- creating more confusion among frustrated people eager to protect themselves against the virus.   The CDC on Wednesday dramatically expanded the testing criteria for the novel coronavirus, formalizing Pence's announcement. The CDC formally removed earlier restrictions that limited coronavirus testing of the general public to people in the hospital, unless they had close contact with confirmed coronavirus cases. According to the CDC, clinicians should now ""use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with COVID-19 and whether the patient should be tested."" During a Senate hearing Tuesday, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn was greeted by skeptical lawmakers and pushed to explain how he thinks the United States could do a million tests when, to date, it has only been able to perform about 3,600 tests.  ""I want to distinguish between the ability to get the test kits out to the laboratories with the ability of the labs to actually do the tests,"" Hahn told lawmakers, offering no clarity on how many tests could actually be run by the end of the week.  This was among a number of government missteps that has left Americans scared and confused about how to protect themselves during the viral outbreak. Outside of US borders, countries debilitated by the virus have seen advancements in the testing process. In South Korea, there's a drive-through testing site that officials say is safer because there is ""less-face-to-face"" contact, and in some countries in Europe, thousands of tests are being run daily. Yet on American soil, a botched roll out of CDC testing, combined with what some health officials now believe was too-strict criteria on who could be tested, caused a delay in testing that some health officials are increasingly concerned about. On Capitol Hill, Pence and his coronavirus response team briefed Republicans and Democrats behind closed doors about the response to the virus, but Democrats left the briefing expressing alarm that the Trump administration was unprepared.  ""We need the questions to be honest, it can't be 'well, we're going to, we're going to' -- that's not what families hear right now,"" said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education Labor and Pensions Committee. ""They hear, 'We will not have a test for three months, and therefore we need you to do this.' We're asking for honesty."" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said he was assured that over a million testing kits ""are going out the door"" and that testing will get ""more robust"" by the end of the week. He said Republicans raised concerns during the briefing about the testing so far, but that his understanding is that the additional kits and increased involvement by commercial manufactures should address that issue, agreeing with colleagues that ""the key is more testing.""  A senior administration official acknowledged the Trump administration is feeling a major sense of urgency to distribute testing kits for the coronavirus, amid bipartisan criticism that the kits are being deployed too slowly. ""It's a flashpoint right now,"" the official said. The official conceded that the question coming in from health professionals nationwide as well from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers is ""Why can't the feds give us tests?"" According to the Association of Public Health Laboratories, a collection of government labs across the country, as of Tuesday evening, 56 out of 100 laboratories are currently capable of conducting the test, each one with the capability to test about 100 patients per day. APHL CEO Scott Becker noted that even if all APHL labs were up and operating at full capacity, they would only be able to test about 10,000 patients a day within the public health system. Becker said the labs must successfully verify the CDC's test before testing for the virus.   ""What we are doing right now in these next few days is playing catch up,"" Becker told CNN, referring to delays resulting from issues with tests delivered to labs last month. ""Admittedly we were behind, but I have good confidence that we will get back on track."" A spokesperson for the FDA said in a statement that state and local public health labs will be able to test up to 75,000 people by the end of the week. That spokesperson added that a commercial manufacturer, IDT, is producing additional CDC tests and expects to have shipped test kits capable of about 1 million tests to academic, healthcare and commercial labs by the week's end.  One public health official who requested anonymity told CNN his lab was currently developing their own test but it would still be weeks before it was live. This official expressed frustration at the current testing situation.  ""The government has not made this process easy for [health officials] to help catch cases of coronavirus before they spread,"" they said. In order to receive test kits from the CDC, labs that are approved by the agency must place an order for the kit. Many state labs will still not be able to immediately run tests as soon as receiving the kit -- opting to first conduct a series of quality control tests — which will prolong the process. Each kit can test about 700 to 800 patient specimens, according to the CDC.  Last month, the CDC announced that some test kits shipped to labs were not working properly and were falsely identifying the presence of other viruses. The tests weren't able to be used for weeks because of the flaw.   On Saturday, the FDA posted new guidance ""to achieve more rapid testing capacity"" that allows certain US labs to test for the novel coronavirus using diagnostics the labs developed and validated on their own, even before the agency has reviewed them. Various private companies have said they are preparing to make coronavirus tests available without providing specific timelines.  LabCorp has said on its website that the company plans to make a test available ""as soon as possible."" A company spokesperson did not respond to a request for more detail. Another diagnostic company, Qiagen, tweeted that it was ""ramping up production"" of coronavirus test kits. Qiagen said in a statement to CNN that it's planning to submit an application to the FDA, but said the process ""does take some time."" California-based company Cepheid told The New York Times that it does not expect to get FDA approval for its test before April. Getting the tests ready is essential as the highly contagious virus continues to spread. According to the CDC, coronavirus is thought to be spread mainly from person to person. Once a person has tested positive for the virus, they can be quarantined and stem the spread.  Michael Mina, assistant professor of epidemiology and immunology at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said the US government has taken ""positive steps"" in recent days when it comes to testing, such as the FDA's policy announced Saturday to allow certain labs to develop and validate their own diagnostics for tests. But Mina added that the CDC hindered the readiness of labs by announcing last month that some test kits shipped to labs were not working as they should but then providing limited information to labs in the weeks that followed.  Surgeon General Jerome Adams said Monday that while the US has seen an increase in coronavirus cases, there's no need to panic. ""Caution is appropriate. Preparedness is appropriate. Panic is not,"" he said. Lawmakers continue to press for additional information about the response to the virus. House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney of New York and other top Oversight Democrats sent letters to Health and Human Services and the CDC seeking more information on testing, diagnoses and the costs of treating coronavirus.  Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington state, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, sent letters to airlines and airports to ask about their plans to deal with the Coronavirus outbreak and their pandemic response plans. And Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida said Tuesday that tests should be free for anyone who experiences symptoms from the virus.  This story has been updated to reflect the CDC's new guidance on testing for coronavirus. Jim Acosta, Arman Azad, Jason Hoffman and Manu Raju contributed to this story. "

Economic activity sharply declined across the board in February as companies struggled to reopen for business or hire workers during a government-mandated shutdown, according to official and private surveys released in recent days. Wednesday revealed shockingly bad news for services in the world's second biggest economy. Chinese media group Caixin said its purchasing managers index for the sector plummeted to 26.5 last month from a reading of 51.8 the month before — the lowest figure recorded by the survey since it began in 2005. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, rather than growth.  ""China's economy is in a very bad way indeed,"" said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale. That data — which mostly follows small and medium-sized companies — largely tracked with a government survey of primarily state-owned firms in the services sector released over the weekend. China's factories also recorded their worst month on record in February, according to government and Caixin data, as companies face extended closures to contain the virus, or struggled to fill jobs because of travel restrictions. ""The virus outbreak has put the government into a difficult situation,"" said Raymond Yeung, chief economist for Greater China at ANZ. ""On one hand, the lockdown policy is the most effective way to contain virus spreading out. On the other hand, the health measures are hindering economic activity."" The gloomy picture painted by the data is reinforced by evidence from coming from big companies. The world's biggest brewer, ABInBev (BUD), said it had lost $285 million in revenue in January and February in China, while iPhone maker Foxconn (HNHPF) said Tuesday it didn't expect production to return to normal until the end of March. The fallout could be crippling for China's economic growth this quarter. Macquarie Group chief China economist Larry Hu suggested that the country could be in for a historic economic decline.  The data ""suggest that things are really bad and the government is willing to report that,"" Hu wrote in a note after the official data was released at the weekend, adding that growth for the first quarter could come in well below estimates currently running at around 4% (down from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2019). ""It's even possible that the government will report negative growth for [the first quarter], the first time since the end of Culture Revolution,"" he added.  China's economy contracted 1.6% in 1976, when Communist Party leader Mao Zedong's death ended a decade-long period of social and political tumult in the country. Since then, China has boomed, growing at an average annual rate of 9.4% between 1978 and 2018 as it embarked on a series of economic reforms.  Hu wrote that China will likely enact more policy measures to help the economy, but added that it's too early to expect a big stimulus package from Beijing.  UBS economists also suspect that China's economy contracted in January and February, noting the poor PMI data in a Tuesday research note.  ""The next two weeks will be critical to track the path of new confirmed cases of coronavirus and the pace of economic normalization,"" wrote Ning Zhang and Tao Wang, economists for UBS. Bad news for jobs The recent data suggest that Beijing's efforts to shore up employment this year are in jeopardy. China's services sector represents about 360 million jobs and accounts for 46% of the labor market, making it the largest source of employment in the country.  Government authorities have been pushing hard to keep unemployment low, wary of the fallout that could happen otherwise. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said last month that officials are ""closely watching the employment issue and will try to prevent massive layoffs.""  He also said stabilizing employment is the government's primary task, and placed special emphasis on new graduates and migrant workers. China's 290 million migrant workers are among those most exposed to a slump, since they often travel from rural areas to the cities to take on construction, manufacturing, or service jobs that would have been tough to find during last month's widespread shutdowns.  Only 80 million migrant workers had returned to work by mid-February, according to the government. In recent days, Beijing has also urged college students to join the army and ordered all public colleges to expand their advanced degree programs — efforts meant to reduce the number of job seekers.

Mark Pocan, who wrote a letter of complaint to the federal agency this week.   For weeks, the CDC posted on its website the number of people who had been tested for the novel coronavirus, but the number disappeared on Monday.   ""All of a sudden those stats vanished,"" said Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat.   Pocan wrote a letter of complaint to the CDC Monday night.   On Tuesday, a CDC spokeswoman said the agency was trying to gather state testing data and might share it on the CDC website.   ""We're working on a system to get [novel coronavirus] test results from state and local public health labs each week and hope to post that,"" CDC's Kristen Nordlund wrote to CNN.   Pocan told CNN that this plan was ""more of an excuse than an answer.""  ""It's continuing to be the slow-walking response they've been having on this,"" Pocan said. ""We need to get tests out now and we need to get results now and if you're not keeping track, how do you have a national strategy?""   On Tuesday morning, the agency explained to CNN why it had stopped reporting the total number of people being tested for the virus. ""Now that states are testing and reporting their own results, CDC's numbers may not represent all of the testing being done nationwide,"" CDC spokeswoman Belsie Gonzalez wrote.   But Pocan responded that the CDC keeps track of national health data for a wide range of diseases and should be able to keep track of testing data for the novel coronavirus on a daily basis.  ""There's only 50 states. We can get this information relatively easily,"" he said.  When the outbreak began in mid-January, the CDC was the only lab able to test for the novel coronavirus. On February 5, the agency announced that the test was being distributed to state, county and city public health labs in the US.   A week later, the CDC explained the test kits weren't working as expected, leading to inconclusive results.   The CDC sent out revised instructions, and last week a handful of labs were able to perform test. This week, the CDC sent out more test kits, and now more public health labs are testing for the virus.   Eventually, a ""significant portion"" of the testing will be done by private labs, according to Nordlund, the CDC spokeswoman. She did not say if the CDC will be reporting on those testing numbers.   CNN's Jen Christensen and Gina Yu contributed to this story."

Since the outbreak began, there have been more than 90,000 cases of the virus worldwide and more than 3,100 deaths from it. As officials work to stop the virus's spread, it is hard not to wonder what will happen next. When and how will this end? Here's a look back at what happened during other infectious outbreaks. Ebola Scientists often intervene during infectious outbreaks with vaccines and antiviral medications.  That was the case in 2014 when an outbreak of Ebola virus in West Africa concluded with strains being ""interrupted,"" the World Health Organization said in March 2016. The outbreak ended after a ""coordinated international response,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez professor and dean for the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. When another outbreak began in 2018, two treatments developed from the first outbreak were offered to all patients in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  ""Both times human intervention made the difference,"" Hotez said, adding that the same could be true for coronavirus. Currently there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral treatment recommended for the novel coronavirus -- but many are in development. ""I'm pretty optimistic we are going to have a good antiviral drug and protocol in the coming weeks and months,"" he said. More than 20 coronavirus vaccines are in development, according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebrevesus, director-general of the World Health Organization. The first clinical trial of an antiviral drug is underway. While Hotez's team is among those working on a vaccine, he said he is not optimistic it will come in the time frame of this outbreak. First, the vaccines must get into clinical trials, then they must get approved, and with the amount of scrutiny in vaccine safety testing, he said, it is not likely one will be available to the public in time to curb this outbreak. SARS  The SARS outbreak was brought to an end in July 2003 by good hygiene practices -- such as frequent hand-washing -- and environmental factors such as high temperature and humidity in the summer months, said John Nicholls, clinical professor of pathology at the University of Hong Kong (HKU). SARS is another strain of coronavirus that infected more than 8,000 people in 2003. By May of that year, it was burnt out, said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. How does an outbreak ""burn out""? Sometimes, Markel said, it's because the weather changes and sometimes it is because enough people have been infected and become immune. ""If I had to predict, I would say very likely by May or June or July this will burn itself out,"" Markel said.  But, that doesn't mean it would be gone for good. H1N1  Outbreaks can change as the seasons do. The H1N1 flu strain caused a pandemic in 2009, and now it has become a seasonally occurring virus.    Seasonal viruses can be seen year-round, but in the Northern Hemisphere cases tend to peak in the colder, winter months and fall when it gets warm, Hotez said. There isn't a clear understanding of why that is, he said, but the humidity levels and time spent huddled indoors are possible reasons. Whether coronavirus will reoccur is anyone's guess, Hotez said. There just isn't enough evidence or enough time to make a good prediction. Lessons learned More certain is that this coronavirus outbreak revives lessons learned from the outbreaks before it, Hotez said.  There is a bumpy road at the start and then authorities regroup as they learn how the pathogen behaves and is transmitted to vulnerable people. The most common resolution is a ""global amnesia,"" Markel said. The virus winds down and the public goes back to their regular lives, not thinking about the outbreak. But that may be a problem. Instead, Markel said, people should remain vigilant and prepared. ""The lesson is that we are living in a new age of infectious disease, and they are going to rear their ugly heads on a regular basis,"" he said. ""The lesson we are not learning is that we need to be prepared for this."" "
"Even without coronavirus, many highly rated nursing homes have infection-control lapses",2020-03-04,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/health/nursing-home-infection-control-coronavirus-partner/index.html,"['https://www.cdc.gov/mrsa/index.html', 'https://khn.org/news/infection-lapses-rampant-in-nursing-homes-but-punishment-is-rare/', 'https://khn.org/news/infection-lapses-rampant-in-nursing-homes-but-punishment-is-rare/', 'https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/adsaapps/lookup/RCSForms/NF/1419/inspection/2019/R%20LIFE%20CARE%20CENTER%20OF%20KIRKLAND%20complaint%20ZPFF11%204-11-19%20em.pdf', 'https://fortress.wa.gov/dshs/adsaapps/lookup/RCSForms/NF/1419/inspection/2019/LIFE%20CARE%20CENTER%20OF%20KIRKLAND%20ZPFF12.pdf', 'https://khn.org/']"," (CNN)Long before the novel coronavirus made its surprise appearance, the nation's nursing homes were struggling to obey basic infection prevention protocols designed to halt the spread of viruses and bacteria they battle daily.  Since the beginning of 2017, government health inspectors have cited more nursing homes for failing to ensure that all workers follow those prevention and control rules than for any other type of violation, according to a Kaiser Health News analysis of federal records.  In all, 9,372 nursing homes, or 61%, were cited for one or more infection-control deficiencies, the analysis showed. It also found violations were more common at homes with fewer nurses and aides than at facilities with higher staffing levels.  Even among nursing homes crowned with the maximum government rating of five stars for overall quality, 4 in 10 have been cited for an infection-control lapse. Those include the Life Care Center of Kirkland, Washington, a Seattle suburb, where five people who had lived at the facility have died. Inspection reports from around the country show many errors are rudimentary, such as workers not washing their hands as they moved to the next patient, or failing to don masks, gloves and gowns when in the rooms of contagious patients in isolation. ""It's all these little things that are part of infection-control practices that when they are added up can create an environment for an infection outbreak,"" said Patricia Hunter, the Washington State Long-Term Care Ombuds, who addresses complaints from residents and families and pushes for improvements in facilities. In recent years, the federal government has been ramping up the standards for nursing homes, but inspectors remain frustrated by the prevalence of sloppy or nonexistent handwashing. ""We have got to do better on handwashing,"" Evan Shulman, the director for the nursing home division of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told an association of nursing home directors in 2018. While citations are rampant across the industry, health inspectors have classified all but 1% of violations as minor and not warranting fines, the KHN analysis found. A single low-level citation usually has limited impact on the overall star rating, the only metric most consumers examine.  The coronavirus has demonstrated its potential lethality among the old and frail in Kirkland, but the infections that nursing homes already battle with mixed success — influenza and antibiotic-resistant bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)— can be equally fatal. As many as 3.8 million infections occur in nursing homes each year, killing nearly 388,000 residents.  Dr. David Gifford, the chief medical officer for the American Health Care Association, the primary nursing home trade group, told reporters Monday that these facilities were ready to deal with coronavirus infections through the prevention plans they have in place. ""We prepare for seasonal influenza ever year — it's very similar to that,"" he said. ""We are reinforcing the information for basic procedures for how to prevent the spread,"" he added, such as keeping infected residents away from others and having sick employees stay home. Yet the same industry deficits that have hampered past infection-control efforts are in play with the coronavirus. Nursing homes experience frequent staff turnover, and new or temporary workers are less likely to be familiar with a facility's protocols. Also, inspectors have found that these homes have had difficulty making sure that potentially infected workers stay home, a problem compounded by the low pay and limited time-off benefits many receive.  During a norovirus outbreak in 2017 at another Washington state nursing home, for instance, at least six infected employees returned to work earlier than they were supposed to. Inspectors discovered the virus ultimately spread to 32 employees and 43 residents — more than 40% of those living in the home, according to an inspection report. Even if nursing homes are successful in getting infected workers to take days off, they may run into trouble finding replacements. Dr. David Nace, director of long-term care and flu programs at the University of Pittsburgh Department of Medicine, said staffing issues are compounded by a national shortage of health care workers. ""Facilities may be faced with the issue of closure if they don't have the staffing,"" he said. KHN's analysis found that 53% of homes with the most nurses and aides — which CMS awards five stars for staffing on its Nursing Home Compare website — had been cited for infection control violations in the past three years, while 65% of homes with the fewest staff — garnering only one star — were cited for the same type of failing. The staffing stars make up one component of the overall rating. ""So many times, when there aren't enough staff, the aides and nurses are literally trying to do 50 things at once, running from person to person,"" said Lori Smetanka, executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C. ""That's when things fall through the cracks, like handwashing, which is the most useful thing to do to prevent infections."" More sparsely staffed nursing homes were also cited more often: one-star facilities averaged 1.5 deficiencies while five-star facilities averaged 1.3 deficiencies. But out of more than 13,000 citations for infection-control lapses, regulators classified only 109 as serious harms or threats to patients. That finding echoed the results of a similar investigation KHN conducted in 2017. ""It shows how ineffectual the enforcement situation is,"" said Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. One such violation was cited last April at the Kirkland nursing home after inspectors there observed a registered nurse treating a patient whose feet were touching the floor, even though one heel had a pressure sore that the resident's daughter said she feared was infected. ""It was unhygienic,"" the daughter told inspectors.  Inspectors also watched another nursing home employee work in the room of a patient with pneumonia without wearing a mask, gown and gloves as required by a sign outside the room. They noted in their report that the facility had experienced two outbreaks of influenza that year, affecting at least 17 residents and seven staff members all told. Inspectors labeled the violations they observed as low level because they caused ""minimal harm or potential for actual harm."" The nursing home pledged to reeducate staff on procedures and investigators found no problems when they revisited two months later. Life Care Center, in an upscale, wooded neighborhood less than a mile from Lake Washington's popular Juanita Beach Park, said in a statement released Monday that it is screening workers before they start work and after and has suspended visits and new admissions.  ""We are also following infection control recommendations, including proper hand-washing techniques and wearing masks, gowns and gloves when caring for any symptomatic patients,"" the statement said. The facility declined to discuss its previous citation. Seema Verma, the CMS administrator, said during a press briefing at the White House Tuesday night that her agency is sending inspectors to the nursing home, as well as a hospital and dialysis center that treated coronavirus patients, to see if federal health and safety regulations were followed. Hunter, the Washington state ombud, said that during her recent visits to 14 nursing homes in three Northwestern states, she observed that aides were generally good about using hand sanitizer but rarely washed residents' hands. Not every resident room had a sink, she said. ""I haven't seen one resident have their hands washed during lunch time or dinner time,"" she said.  While some nursing homes are making concerted efforts, ""there are nursing homes that are really dirty and there are concerns that they're not getting the job done,"" Hunter added."" The trouble is when you don't have enough workers, or you don't have a stable workforce that's trained to follow your protocol, that's a weakness in the system."" In 2016, CMS updated and expanded its infection-control rules, requiring among other things that each facility appoint one person to be in charge of infection control. CMS required the employee in that position, known as an infection preventionist, to complete specialized training and work at the facility either part time or full time. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating the on-site requirement.  Instead, CMS proposed the preventionist be someone who has spent ""sufficient time"" at the facility to oversee its infection-control efforts. It has asked the public for advice on how to define sufficient.  ""We believe this is an appropriate standard,"" the agency wrote in its proposed rule, issued last July. ""However, we are also concerned that there could be a substantial variance in how LTC [long-term care] facilities interpret this requirement.""

""Protect yourself and your community from coronavirus with common sense precautions: wash your hands, stay home when sick and listen to the @CDCgov and local health authorities,"" the former President tweeted. ""Save the masks for health care workers. Let's stay calm, listen to the experts, and follow the science."" His comment comes following fears of the virus' outbreak in the US, and a botched roll out of  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testing that -- combined with what some health officials now believe was too-strict criteria on who could be tested -- caused a delay in testing that some health officials are increasingly concerned about. There are at least 130 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus in the US, the CDC reported Wednesday afternoon, and 10 people have died from the virus nationally. Health officials have urged Americans to wash their hands as a method of protection and to stop buying masks out of concern of a shortage for health care workers. Congressional negotiators on Wednesday struck a deal on a sweeping spending package to spend billions on dealing with the coronavirus, according to two sources involved with the talks. The White House is expected to back the deal, which is set to be voted on by the House Wednesday. During a meeting with airline executives on Wednesday, President Donald Trump sought to reassure the public that the fatality rate from coronavirus could drop as more tests are done. ""If you add, you know, many, many people that have it and don't know they have it, or think they have a cold and all of sudden they're recovering from it, I think that number will probably be a lot different number,"" the President said during the meeting. Vice President Mike Pence also said in an off-camera briefing at the White House Tuesday evening that there was new guidance from the CDC that any American could be tested -- ""no restrictions, subject to doctors' orders."" The announcement follows numerous complaints of citizens asking to be tested and turned away due to the strict CDC testing criteria. Pence said the new guidance will make clear ""that any clinician or health authority can administer the test."" The change was announced after confusion over how quickly the US could ramp up testing for roughly 1 million people for coronavirus. After suggesting Monday that the US would be able to test close to 1 million people for coronavirus by the end of the week, the Trump administration has since clarified -- creating more confusion among frustrated people eager to protect themselves against the virus. CNN's Nikki Carvajal, Curt Devine, Jeremy Herb, Kristen Holmes and Manu Raju contributed to this report."

Sixty-seven-year-old Goldman, from Los Angeles, is among the more than 160 Americans confirmed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus, and he is doing his best to take the stroke of bad luck in his stride.  He also marvels at how he has become an object of intense scientific interest. ""They are swabbing everything I touch,"" Goldman said, speaking to CNN by phone from his isolation room on Wednesday. ""They put a unit in (the quarantine room) to capture the air to get a better understanding of how this virus is moving inside my body and outside my body."" Goldman and other Americans who experienced life in quarantine describe a life of surreal boredom mixed with an uneasy uncertainty. Cheryl and Paul Molesky were quarantined for 28 days in total -- 12 aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, and 16 in a room at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Cheryl compared the military quarantine unit to a $50 hotel room. ""It wasn't that bad -- it had a little refrigerator and a microwave,"" she told CNN by phone, speaking from her home in Syracuse, New York, after she was allowed to return there early Wednesday morning. He still gets his 10,000 steps a day Goldman also was also on the Diamond Princess when he tested positive for the coronavirus. By Thursday, he had been under solitary quarantine for 21 days at the University of Nebraska's hospital system in Omaha. Goldman said the symptoms started with a high fever that set in during a plane ride from Tokyo to Omaha. ""Unlike colds or the flu, there's no runny nose, no sneezing, no body aches,"" he said. ""Even when I had the high fever, which was over 103, there were no chills. No sore throat."" Goldman, who has been blogging about his experience, said healthcare workers downgraded him about a week ago, as his condition has improved -- though he tested positive for the virus again on Monday. ""I still have the remnants of a dry cough,"" he said.  The first 12 days of Goldman's solitary quarantine were spent in a tiny biocontainment room. He has since been moved to a larger unit that is equipped with a TV, bed, internet access and a stationary bicycle. ""I've been walking the room to get 10,000 steps a day, and here it's 14 steps till I hit the wall,"" he said, ""which is a joy because when I was in the biocontainment it was seven steps."" 12 days in quarantine: A 'test for any marriage' Prior to his solitary containment, Goldman and his wife, Jeri -- with whom he owns a radio station in California -- were quarantined together on the ship for 12 days. ""That's a test for any marriage,"" he joked. ""We made it through that; we can make it through anything."" They flew together to Omaha, but were housed separately. She did not test positive for the virus and has returned to Los Angeles. Goldman says the isolation isn't so bad. ""I'm fine,"" he said. ""They do a town hall meeting every day at 3 o'clock, so all the patients here get on. We're talking to CDC officials, they've got a psychologist, so I'm good that way."" A birthday party in quarantine Goldman said he has received several acts of kindness. He celebrated his 67th birthday in solitary quarantine on February 22, but a medical worker delivered him a cake -- while wearing a hazmat suit. ""They sang 'Happy Birthday' to me -- the entire medical team,"" he said. ""Virtually, from ... two-way television -- from central command down the hall."" Earlier this week, Bill Smedley and his wife weren't sure they were going to make it back to their Pennsylvania home this week. The Diamond Princess passengers had been quarantined in San Antonio and were told that another two-week stay could be on the way.  Still, they were released on Tuesday and able to make the last leg of their journey home. Bill Smedley said he felt it was unreal -- half expecting to be stopped on his way out of the military base he and his wife were held at. ""I thought they might come get us when we were at the airport,"" Smedley said, referring to government workers. For the Moleskys, the time spent in quarantine -- nearly a month -- was by turns scary and bizarre, Cheryl said. Food was delivered by people wearing masks, eye shields, gowns and gloves. There were multiple daily temperature checks and doctor visits. ""Some people said it's like prison,"" Cheryl said. ""It wasn't exactly like prison -- we were much, much, much, much better treated than prison. But we definitely had our freedom restricted."" "

It better stay that way if the US economy is going to remain strong through a coronavirus scare. Friday's jobs report is expected to show that February was yet another strong month for American workers. Economists expect the US economy added 175,000 new jobs last month, leaving the unemployment rate at 3.6%, close to a five-decade low. Paychecks probably grew reasonably well too: Average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen 0.3% in February and 3% year-over-year. A solid February for the labor market might be more important than ever. Worries about the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak are weighing on the global growth outlook. If February was worse than expected for jobs, that could send jitters down investors' spines: Good February or bad, March could be downright ugly as the damage from coronavirus truly takes hold. The March report is due April 3. Coronavirus ""didn't really become a major scare until the last week of the month, so we may not see this weigh heavy on the February report,"" JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, told CNN Business in emailed comments. Sectors like hospitality and travel, which took a hit because of travel cancellations might start cutting jobs because of the virus outbreak, Kinahan added. A weaker-than-expected February report could call into question the state of the US economy, said Citi economists Veronica Clark and Andrew Hollenhorst. Some market participants have long thought that the US economy is at the end of its expansionary cycle. Consumer spending, which drives some 70% of US GDP growth, has remained strong in the face of recent macroeconomic problems like last year's trade war. But if people stop going to stores, movies, concerts or trips, that could deal a big blow to those industries and put a major dent in consumer spending. Although paychecks have only been growing modestly, inflation has also been low, meaning that workers have seen their spending power grow. But worries about how the coronavirus outbreak might affect consumer spending are beginning to grow. Countries like China, where the outbreak originated, are bracing for painful data in the first quarter of the year. Supply chains, trade and travel are bearing the initial brunt of the outbreak's economic effects. But in America, economists continue to praise the strong fundamentals underpinning the economy, including its solid labor market and consumer spending, as well as an economy less reliant on trade than its European and Asian peers. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made sure to point to the strength of the US even as he announced an emergency half-percentage point cut Tuesday to protect America's longest expansion in history. That may hold true for February. March is anyone's guess. "

Last year, Dorsey said he didn't know where he would be living on the continent, but he planned to spend between three and six months of 2020 in Africa. ""I had been working on my plans where I'd work decentralized, as my team and I do when we travel, but in light of COVID-19 and everything else going on I need to reevaluate,"" Dorsey said at a conference in San Francisco hosted by Morgan Stanley focused on tech, media and telecom. ""Either way we'll continue to pursue opportunities in Africa,""  Globally, there are over 94,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, also called COVID-19, and nearly 3,300 deaths, mostly in China. The first case of the coronavirus in South Africa has been diagnosed, the country's health minister announced Thursday. This week, Senegal reported four cases. However, Africa has recorded fewer cases of coronavirus compared to other continents. Earlier this week, Twitter said it was strongly encouraging all employees globally to work from home if they're able. Over the weekend, Twitter said it would be suspending all ""non-critical"" business travel and events.   Dorsey added that Africa will be ""one of the most populated continents"" in the next 20 to 30 years, with a large part of the population still coming online. He said this presents a ""huge opportunity"" for young people on the continent to join Twitter.  The remarks come as Dorsey, who is also the CEO of payments company Square, faces pressure from an activist investor to give up his top spot at one of the two companies. The practice raises concerns about how much time the CEO can dedicate to each company and the potential for burnout.  Last week, activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. obtained a large stake in Twitter and is advocating for changes, including possibly replacing Dorsey, a source familiar with the matter previously confirmed to CNN Business.  The source said Elliott was open to the possibility of Dorsey staying as long as he was willing to give up his role as CEO of Square (SQ). But the source conceded that Dorsey is unlikely to do that, and that is why Twitter should look for a new full-time CEO. (Twitter and Elliott Management previously declined to comment.) "

Here's what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door.  (You can also get ""5 Things You Need to Know Today"" delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) 1. Election 2020 Mike Bloomberg is out. Less than a day after his deeply disappointing Super Tuesday, the media magnate suspended his more than half-a-billion-dollar campaign and endorsed ... Joe Biden. Biden, riding a surprise set of Super Tuesday victories, is now the top mark for GOP politicians and those hoping to stop his surge toward a Democratic nomination. Senate Republicans are sharpening their investigations involving the former vice president, his son Hunter Biden and Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company on whose board Hunter Biden served. Committee members have gotten access to classified documents and may subpoena a former Burisma consultant. Some top Democrats, meanwhile, are worried Biden's momentum could set the stage for a most unwanted repeat of 2016, when a clash between an establishment candidate and Bernie Sanders divided party support, and, well, you know what happened next.  2. Abortion  The Supreme Court heard the first major abortion case brought before its new conservative majority. The case concerns a controversial Louisiana abortion access law that critics say would leave just one doctor in the state to perform the procedure. A similar law in Texas was struck down four years ago by the high court, but with its new makeup, this law could be upheld. Though the court appeared divided after hours of oral arguments, Chief Justice John Roberts asked questions that indicated he may be in favor of reversing precedent and allowing new state restrictions on abortion. Abortion rights advocates fear the conservative court could gut longstanding precedents, while some states, like Louisiana, are taking advantage of the possibility by passing more restrictive laws. The case will be decided by July, just as the presidential race heats up. 3. Coronavirus  Global cases of the coronavirus have topped 95,000 as countries employ new strategies to try to contain the spread. Iran, one of the worst-hit countries so far, has announced it is developing a vaccine and is ready to send out test kits. In New York City, about 1,000 people have been asked to self-quarantine after 11 new cases were reported there. Flights have been cut in the US, Italy has closed down schools nationwide, and speculation is mounting as to how Japan will proceed with the Tokyo Olympics, which are less than 150 days away. Meanwhile, India has identified 29 coronavirus cases, prompting fears that the world's second-most populous country could become a viral powder keg. Meantime, Britain's Prince William, who made several ""jokes"" about the coronavirus while meeting emergency workers at a reception in Dublin hosted by Britain's ambassador to Ireland. 4. Ukraine  Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has replaced the country's Prime Minister, saying he hopes the new PM would ""do the impossible."" What is the impossible? Zelensky says he wants a government that will serve the people instead of special or corrupt interests. The new appointee, Denis Shmygal, is the country's third PM in just over six months and replaces Oleksiy Honcharuk. The outgoing PM got into hot water last month when leaked recordings appeared to capture him criticizing Zelensky's economic policy. Zelensky, of course, is of keen interest to President Trump and the US, as a call between the two leaders was at the center of Trump's impeachment investigation.  5. Ebola And now, some good news: The Democratic Republic of Congo's last Ebola patient was discharged, marking a new step toward the end of the world's second-deadliest outbreak of the disease. Health care workers were seen singing and dancing as others gathered to see the patient leave the hospital. A regional director for the World Health Organization praised the tireless efforts of Congo's medical professionals and added that the country must stay vigilant to completely stamp out the disease. An estimated 2,226 people were killed in this outbreak in Congo. Four African countries, including Congo, recently licensed an Ebola vaccine, and the WHO says more nations will soon follow suit.  BREAKFAST BROWSE Twitter is testing disappearing posts called 'Fleets'  Don't let this trick you into thinking everything you say on the internet isn't preserved, in some way, forever.  An NHL player needed 90 stitches after he was hit with a skate blade near his eye Hockey: Not even once.  Courtney Stodden and actor Doug Hutchison, who married when she was 16 and he 50, have divorced  Her Instagram post about it is a speech to behold.  An egg a day may be fine for you after all, a new study says Please update your ""Are eggs bad for you?"" scorecards.  The winner of a mayoral race in Vermont is a therapy dog  This feels right.
