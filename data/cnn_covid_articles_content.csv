Democrats have criticized President Donald Trump and other government agencies over a lack of preparedness, with some going as far to say the administration is downplaying the seriousness of the virus.   Pressed by Tapper about Trump Jr's claims that Democrats ""seemingly hope"" Americans will die from coronavirus to hurt the President in the November election, Pence said it is ""understandable"" the President's son would want to respond to the criticism.  ""As the President said, this is no time for politics. And frankly, I think that was Don Jr.'s point. That there has been some very strong rhetoric directed at the President by some members of Congress..,"" the vice president said. ""But responding to the kind of things that have been hurled is understandable."" Pence continued, ""But what the President's charged us to do, in my conversation with Speaker Pelosi, with Senator (Chuck) Schumer, my conversations with Republican and Democratic governors, is to set the politics aside on this and to work the problem. And I want to assure your viewers, that's exactly what we're doing."" Tapper noted that Republicans have also chimed in with negative comments toward Democrats over coronavirus. Pence interjected, ""Well, look, what I am telling you is that this is really a time for us to come together."" Rep. Ted Lieu called for Pence, who was appointed to oversee the coronavirus reponse, to resign from his role for defending Trump's son's ""shameful comments."" ""Dear @VP Pence: You need to resign from your coronavirus position with your shameful defense of shameful comments,"" the California Democrat tweeted Sunday.  Former Vice President Joe Biden on Sunday slammed the Trump administration's response.  ""We knew that this was coming. Back as far as January. They didn't even begin to prepare the testing kits. I mean, this is something that's kind of elementary. We talked about testing kits, we're now going to get them,"" Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union.""  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday called the administration's response ""opaque and often chaotic."" At a rally in South Carolina Friday, the President accused Democrats of ""politicizing"" the virus, saying, ""This is their new hoax."" Asked Saturday if he regretted calling the virus outbreak a hoax, Trump insisted that he didn't.  ""Hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody,"" Trump said of administration critics. ""I'm not talking about what's happening here, I'm talking about what they're doing."" Trump said the criticism was a ""continuation of the hoax,"" and mentioned the Russia investigation and his impeachment. ""I don't like it when they are criticizing these people and I don't like it,"" he said. ""That's the hoax I'm talking about."" "

""The Louvre cannot open this Sunday, March 1,"" a statement from the Louvre said. ""Museum staff met to discuss the health situation and the Covid-19 prevention measures taken by the museum following instructions from the competent authorities.""  It's not clear when the home of Leonardo DaVinci's ""Mona Lisa"" and a half million other pieces of art will reopen.

France, like many countries around the world, is scrambling to contain the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 2,900 people and infected over 85,000 worldwide since December.  At least 100 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus have been reported in France, including two deaths.  On Saturday, the French government issued an order canceling all public gatherings of more than 5,000 people within confined spaces. That forced the cancellation of the Paris Half Marathon on Sunday, but the directive did not apply to the Louvre Museum.

""We knew that this was coming. Back as far as January. They didn't even begin to prepare the testing kits. I mean, this is something that's kind of elementary. We talked about testing kits, we're now going to get them,"" Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" after being asked about the administration's response.  There had been a strain on testing capabilities since novel coronavirus was first detected in the United States in January. In the early weeks of the virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was the only facility in the US that could test for the virus. Since then, coronavirus test kits have been shipped to labs across the country, but some produced inconclusive results. The CDC said it would remake parts of the test kits, and Vice President Mike Pence told Tapper on the same program Sunday that more than 15,000 kits have been mailed to state and local clinics. ""Look, I don't want to talk down the possibility of us being able to do this well, but, you know, the idea that Donald Trump said just several days ago this was a Democratic hoax. What in God's name is he talking about?"" Biden added Sunday. ""Has he no shame?""  The President said at a rally in South Carolina Friday that Democrats are now ""politicizing"" the virus. ""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,"" Trump said. ""They have no clue, they can't even count their votes in Iowa."" On Saturday, Trump clarified that he doesn't think coronavirus itself is a ""hoax,"" but the criticism is. Asked if he regretted calling it a hoax during Friday's rally, Trump said he didn't. The comments from Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, come hours after he won the South Carolina primary in a critical victory that has provided a much-needed boost for his campaign. ""I know what I would have done differently and what we did in the Ebola crisis,"" Biden told Tapper. ""I heard Vice President (Mike Pence) say they set up an office in the White House. We had an office in the White House. We, after -- us dealing with the pandemic that could have been incredibly dangerous and affected the world, Ebola, we set up an entire mechanism of how the deal with future outbreaks of pandemic diseases. They eliminated that office when they came in play.""  ""They cut the funding for CDC ... they tried to cut the funding at, you know, in terms of (the Department of Health and Human Services). And so, what, look, here, we knew that this was coming. We knew this was coming,"" Biden told Tapper. President Donald Trump announced Sunday new screening procedures for coronavirus. The President tweeted that people will be screened for coronavirus upon arriving in the US if they are traveling from high-risk countries. In a rare Saturday news conference, the administration also announced new travel restrictions following news of the first US fatality from the disease. The patient died in Washington and appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, who spoke alongside the President at a briefing Saturday. Biden said Sunday that the Trump administration, which has placed Pence in charge of the White House's response, should ""let the scientists speak, and let them tell us what is going on and let them prepare us.""  ""What are we doing? Why are we just getting started? I would have not have dismantled the organization that we put in place in the first place,"" he said, adding that he would've made sure American scientists were sent to China and European countries to gather information about the spread of the disease.

The President will also visit the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, on Tuesday, according to the White House. That trip will also be related to the effort against the coronavirus. Administration officials weighed having Trump visit the CDC weeks ago, but he never followed through on the initial plans, the official said. It's unclear if Vice President Mike Pence, who was recently placed in charge of the administration's response to the outbreak, will join the President on the trip. Politico first reported Trump would be making the trip to the CDC. The visit comes as Trump has fumed in recent days at Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.  Messonnier recently said of a potential outbreak in the US, ""It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen."" Trump thought officials like Messonnier were causing unnecessary alarm over the disease, which claimed the life of a man in Washington this weekend, marking the first US fatality.  The now-deceased patient appears to have become ill through community spread, according to Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the CDC, who spoke alongside the President at a briefing Saturday.

And he wasn't alone. ""I'm Vice President Mike Pence,"" Bennett said. ""Most of you know me from the sentence 'Even if Trump was removed, we'd still be stuck with Mike Pence.'""  Bennett's Pence then explained that President Trump had put him in charge of combating the coronavirus, ""even though I don't believe in science."" ""And I have to admit, this disease has been quite the test of my faith,"" he said. ""Just like dinosaur bones."" He then took questions from the White House press pool. The first question came from Mike Bloomberg, who was played by Fred Armisen. ""What are you doing here? How'd you get past security?"" Bennett's Pence asked.  ""Well, I just walked in coughing and everybody got out of my way,"" Armisen's Bloomberg responded.  Then, he asked Bennett's Pence if it seems ""like a good time to have a president that's competent and capable"" even if that candidate lacks charisma and the ability to connect with human beings? Sen. Elizabeth Warren, played by Kate McKinnon, popped up from behind a podium to torment Armisen's Bloomberg. ""Did you really think you were going to get away from me that easy?"" she said. ""This is my job now. I follow you around and make your life a living hell. I might be fifth in the polls, but I'm No. 1 in your nightmares."" This led this week's host, John Mulaney, to join the conversation as former Vice President Joe Biden.  ""Now, listen, folks, if we want to fight 'China cough' we got to be smart,"" he said. ""We got to make sure to get new teeth daily."" Mulaney's Biden was then interrupted by Sen. Bernie Sanders, played by Larry David.  ""You got to admit, folks, universal healthcare doesn't sound too crazy now, does it?"" David's Sanders said. McKinnon's Warren then told the crowd to make sure that they use Purell hand sanitizer. ""No, no, no, no, no! No Purell,"" David's Sanders said. ""I got a bottle of that junk and on the label it said, 'it kills 99.99% of germs. What happens to the top .01%?!

Shincheonji director denies responsibility for South Korea coronavirus infections,2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/asia/shincheonji-director-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html,"['https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/wuhan-coronavirus-intl-hnk', 'https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/26/asia/shincheonji-south-korea-hnk-intl/index.html']"," (CNN)The director of the religious group at the center of South Korea's novel coronavirus outbreak has denied responsibility for the recent spike in infections, saying authorities were trying to ""exaggerate"" its involvement to shift blame. Kim Shin-chang, director of international missions for the Shincheonji religious group, told CNN Sunday that members had been fully transparent and cooperative with authorities in trying to contain the outbreak. The coronavirus, formally known as Covid-19, has infected 3,526 people and killed 17 in South Korea.  Health authorities say more than half of all cases are related to Shincheonji -- an offshoot of Christianity -- and a specific branch in the southern city of Daegu. South Korea's Ministry of Justice last week said that 42 Shincheonji members had traveled from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus originated, to South Korea since July. Many of the cases in other countries came from people who had traveled to Wuhan, or had been in contact with someone who had -- meaning the 42 members could have brought back the virus if they were traveling during the peak of the outbreak. Kim told CNN there were 357 Shincheonji members based in Wuhan. He said that while the group didn't have official travel records for all its members, ""we have no record"" of any coming from Wuhan into South Korea since November. He said the outbreak began in December -- so there was no need to check members' travel history from July. ""It makes me wonder if they are trying to exaggerate the link or possibly move the responsibility to Shincheonji,"" he said. ""I would like to ask the Ministry of Justice why they did not check all Chinese and Korean citizens (traveling) from Wuhan since July, and why they only released the number of 42 (Shincheonji) members."" The Ministry of Justice said it had pulled the immigration records from July on request of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). CNN has reached out to KCDC for comment. 'We did our best in the situation' After identifying and announcing the Shincheonji link on February 18, South Korean authorities raced to contain the spread of the virus, tracking down thousands of attendees to trace their contacts and symptoms. It took a week before the group gave a list of member's names to authorities. About 600 Daegu police officers were deployed to knock on doors, track phones, and scour security camera footage to find them, as members often don't answer phone calls from nonmembers. Daegu's mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said Friday that the group had also omitted some members in a list of attendees submitted to city authorities, and that he would report the group to police for ""hampering the city's measures to contain the virus."" Kim apologized ""to the Korean people for the worries we have caused"" -- but insisted Shincheonji had been fully transparent. ""We shut down all offices to prevent further spread, and our administrative process has become delayed as all members are working from home so they can self-isolate themselves to the fullest extent,"" he said. ""I'm sure there have been areas where we could have done better but we do want to emphasize that we did our best in the situation."" Kim also admitted members had been encouraged to deny being part of the group — not to conceal any vital information or to hamper the coronavirus investigation, but because ""Shincheonji is perceived as a cult, and because of this many members are discriminated against."" He dismissed other accusations too, like claims by former member Duhyen Kim that illness was never accepted as a valid reason to miss services. In February, Duhyen Kim described to CNN how, when he was a member, followers would sit on the floor during hours-long services ""packed together like sardines."" He and several other former members described how attendees are not allowed to wear masks during prayer time, as it was seen as ""disrespectful to God."" Such claims were outdated and inaccurate, said Kim Shin Chang, adding that since January, members with symptoms had been told not to come in, or to wear masks during service.  ""So there is no evidence that our service method is the reason we are seeing such an outbreak in our group,"" he said. What is Shincheonji, and how did the virus spread? Shincheonji Church of Jesus, the Temple of the Tabernacle of the Testimony was established on March 14, 1984. It was founded by Lee Man-hee, who is revered as a god-like figure within the group -- he is even believed to be ""the second coming of Jesus Christ,"" said Duhyen Kim. The virus is believed to have spread through cases who attended a Shincheonji service or were in contact with attendees, authorities say. Between January 31 and February 2, an unknown number of members came together for the funeral of the founder's brother, who had been hospitalized near the southern city of Daegu.Numerous confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths have since been recorded from the same hospital. Then, on February 18, South Korea reported its 31st case -- a 61-year-old woman with no prior overseas travel history or contact with other confirmed cases. A cluster of infections followed. By February 20, the national tally had increased from 31 to 156 and the first death was reported. While tracing the movements of the 31st patient, the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spotted a link between the new patients: case number 31 had attended a Shincheonji service with hundreds others in Daegu. Once the link to the religious group was established, authorities sprang into action, quarantining attendees, disinfecting buildings, and closing down the group's services. The group says it has about 245,000 members in total, with more than 31,000 from overseas. An internal document from 2017, called the ""International Missions Department status report,"" provided to CNN by former members, said the group has eight branches in the US, with the LA chapter being the largest with more than 1,000 members, as well as dozens of chapters in China.

""In addition to screening travelers 'prior to boarding' from certain designated high risk countries, or areas within those countries, they will also be screened when they arrive in America,"" Trump tweeted Sunday morning. Asked which countries would fall into the ""high risk"" designation, Trump mentioned, Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence, clarified later Sunday that ""this will be expanded to Italy and South Korea. Additionally we are currently working on exit screening from South Korea, Italy, and other European Nations as needed."" Screening was already in place for those traveling into the US who have been in China in the last 14 days. In a rare Saturday press conference, the Trump administration announced the State Department would raise the travel advisory level for parts of Italy and South Korea where the coronavirus has spread widely. The administration also announced expanded travel bans on Iran, another country that the virus has ravaged as it spreads across the globe. Trump and top members of his coronavirus task force have sought to calm fears that sent markets tumbling last week.  Trump on Saturday warned Americans that although more cases are ""likely,"" most healthy people who contract the illness will recover and the risk to the average American remains low. And Pence told CNN's Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" that while the administration knows there will be more cases and that it's possible Americans could die from the disease, ""the American people should know the risk for the average American remains low."" Members of the administration's coronavirus task force -- of which Trump placed Pence in charge earlier this week -- have met frequently as they weigh measures aimed at stopping a wide outbreak in the US.  Pence told Tapper that more than 15,000 testing kits are in the mail to state and local clinics. Officials, though, have warned people against buying masks in preparation for coronavirus, saying doing so could place a strain on the resources health care providers need to provide treatment safely.   Minutes before the President's press conference Saturday, Washington state confirmed the first US death from coronavirus.  The President said Saturday that there are now 22 cases of the novel coronavirus in the US. This number does not include individuals repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China, or from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Those cases have been counted separately by the CDC.

Police departments put out fake warnings about coronavirus contaminated drugs,2020-03-01,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/01/us/coronavirus-police-test-drugs-trnd/index.html,[]," (CNN)Some police departments are putting out fake warnings that illicit drugs could be contaminated with coronavirus in an effort to make drug arrests.  The Tavares Police Department in Florida and the Merrill Police Department in Wisconsin are among those that have taken to social media offering to test methamphetamine and other drugs. ""If you have recently purchased Meth, it may be contaminated,"" with coronavirus, Merrill Police Department said on Facebook. ""If you're not comfortable going into an office setting, please request any officer and they'll test your Meth in the privacy of your home. Please spread the word! We are here for you!"" ""Bring it by our station and we will test your batch within minutes!"" Tavares Police Department said.  At least 2,976 people have died from coronavirus globally. There are now 71 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of the virus in the United States, including one fatality.  Some people criticized the department's posts online. ""I would rather not see police departments making 'jokes' like this online or posting false information about a pandemic that is already being treated cavalierly by the executive branch,"" Jessica Thill commented on Merrill Police Department's post. ""This would be funnier if addiction (often a maladaptive coping skill formed as a result of trauma experienced in the form of abuse, neglect, abandonment, etc. during vital development stages of the brain during a human being's life) wasn't a disease that devastates individuals, their families, and their communities,"" another commenter, Karriann Elise, said. The post from Merrill police was updated to acknowledge the critical comments it received. But, the department added, similar ploys have worked before and are done with the intention of keeping people safe. ""Just to give you some history, we have actually experienced people report their illegal drugs being stolen, being ripped off in a drug deal, being sold a look-a-like illegal substance, etc.,"" the department said. ""So this attempt, although a long shot, still had some possibility behind it."" ""It is our hope that every drug arrest both works to hold offenders accountable for their deeds and provides them with a path toward treatment options."" Police departments using social media to push fake drug campaigns have caused a stir before. In July, a Tennessee police department warned against flushing drugs down toilets and sinks because it could create meth gators. The post was not meant to be taken seriously, the department said. ""Let us be perfectly clear: the meth gator was a humorous illustration used to highlight the dangers of flushing drugs and other substances down your toilet,"" the Loretto Police Department wrote on Facebook.

But that madness could fade away this year if one players' advocacy group gets its way.  The National College Players Association (NCPA) has asked the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to consider having its men's and women's basketball tournaments with no crowds in the arenas due to coronavirus fears.  ""In regard to the NCAA's March Madness Tournament and other athletic events, there should be a serious discussion about holding competitions without an audience present,"" the NCPA said in a statement Saturday. The NCPA advocates for better health and financial protections for college athletes.  ""Google just cancelled a summit in California and Amazon is encouraging its employees to avoid all nonessential travel because of coronavirus concerns,"" the statement continued. ""The NCAA and its colleges must act now, there is no time to waste."" The NCPA also called for the NCAA to cancel events where players would be in contact with crowds. ""The NCAA and its colleges should take precautions to protect college athletes,"" the group said. ""Athletic programs should also take every possible measure to sanitize buses and airplanes used to transport players."" In response to the request, the NCAA said it is monitoring developments with the coronavirus outbreak.  ""NCAA staff continues to prepare for all NCAA winter and spring championships, but we are keenly aware of coronavirus and will continue to monitor in coordination with state/local health authorities and the CDC,"" NCAA spokesman Greg Johnson said in a statement. ""The NCAA Sport Science Institute sent two memos recently to NCAA members directing schools and conference offices to Center for Disease Control and Prevention resources on the issue."" The NCAA men's basketball tournament starts with the First Four on Tuesday, March 17. The women's tournament starts Friday, March 20.
